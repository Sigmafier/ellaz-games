/* Sending a report - a copy of `sdk/cloud.ts`'s shape, and deliberately not an
   import of it.
   ===========================================================================

   WHY THIS DOES NOT REUSE THE BACKUP CLIENT'S IDENTITY
   `cloud.ts` signs in anonymously and keeps `{uid, refreshToken, code}` under
   `ellaz:cloud:v1`. Reusing that uid here would work, cost one less round trip,
   and quietly make every report joinable to a child's profile document - their
   coins, their room, their records - by anyone who could read both. A separate
   anonymous identity under `ellaz:report:v1` costs one sign-up on the first
   report ever sent and makes that join impossible rather than merely
   discouraged. Identity separation you can point at in a rule beats identity
   separation you have to remember.

   It also keeps the chunks apart: importing `cloud.ts` would pull the whole
   backup client, its code encoder and its records validator into a chunk that
   needs none of them.

   EVERYTHING HERE IS FAIL-SOFT
   A report is a courtesy. It must never throw into a game, never block a tap,
   and never leave the sheet claiming something the network did not do - see
   `.claude/rules/destructive-actions-show-both-sides.md`. Every path resolves
   to a `SendOutcome`, and the sheet renders that outcome rather than assuming.

   THE DOC ID IS THE THROTTLE
   The id is the current minute, and `firestore.rules` checks it against
   `request.time`, so a caller cannot invent ids to get around it. A second
   report inside the same minute is a create against an existing document, which
   Firestore answers 409 - a normal, expected outcome, reported as `throttled`
   rather than as a failure. */

 * The SERVER's clock, off the `Date` header every Google API reply carries.

 * This is not a nicety. The throttle id is a minute stamp and `firestore.rules`
 * compares it to `request.time` with a +/-2 minute window, so a device whose
 * clock is 3 minutes out is refused on EVERY report, forever - and the sheet
 * answers a 403 with "That did not send. Try again?", which resends a
 * byte-identical id. Measured 2026-09-02: 0/1/2 min skew send, 3 and 4 are
 * refused, and three taps of Try again produced one id and three 403s.
 *
 * The clock a guard compares against is the only clock worth stamping with.
 *
 * THIS DEPENDS ON A CORS EXPOSURE, so it is measured rather than assumed.
 * `Date` is NOT a CORS-safelisted response header, so a cross-origin reply can
 * carry it and the browser can still refuse to let us read it - in which case
 * this returns undefined, the local clock is used, and the bug is back with
 * every test still green. Measured 2026-09-02 through a real browser's own CORS
 * filter, from an http origin, against both hosts we call:
 *
 *   identitytoolkit accounts:signUp  visible=[content-encoding,content-length,
 *                                    content-type,date,server,vary]
 *   firestore.googleapis.com         same, plus x-debug-tracking-id
 *
 * If Google ever stops exposing it this degrades silently, which is why the
 * fallback below is a fallback and not an error.
