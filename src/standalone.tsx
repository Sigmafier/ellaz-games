/**
 * The entry for a STANDALONE single-game bundle, hosted by somebody else.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN REUSING `bootContentPage`.
 * `src/portal/PageApp.tsx` is the entry every content page uses, and it calls
 * `analytics.init()`, `analytics.track("session_start")` and `startCloudSync()`
 * unconditionally (lines 109-111). `startCloudSync` subscribes the wallet and
 * pushes to Firestore on `visibilitychange`. The same module also mounts the
 * World and the Boards.
 *
 * So reusing it here would ship the room, the shop and the leaderboards inside
 * a single-game bundle AND open a Firestore write loop from a third-party
 * iframe on someone else's domain - a direct breach of "no external network
 * requests from games", which is the rule that lets this SDK be listed on Poki
 * or CrazyGames at all.
 *
 * Those are STATIC imports. No `manualChunks` branch and no `globIgnores` entry
 * can remove them; only a different entry can, and this is it. The first draft
 * of the plan got this wrong and described it as a chunking problem.
 *
 * `main.tsx` is unusable here for a second, harder reason: it imports
 * `virtual:pwa-register`, which only exists while the PWA plugin is loaded -
 * and this build deliberately has no PWA plugin.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * No analytics. No cloud sync. No service worker. No router. No prose. It
 * mounts one game and offers one way home.
