 * The form every game page fills in, once per language.

 * authored prose. Everything a page could get WRONG about the game - the
 * difficulty tiers, what the record measures, whether it works offline - is
 * read from `meta.ts`, the game's own `DifficultySelector` options and
 * `sdk/score.ts` at render time, so a writer cannot claim something the game
 * does not do. See `.claude/rules/game-content-template.md`.
 *
 * This module imports one thing, and only one: the list of languages that have
 * prose. `no-app-imports.test.ts` keeps the app from importing this module
 * back - which is what keeps ~200 KB of prose out of the precached shell. The
 * arrow the other way is safe and deliberate: `src/i18n/locales.ts` is a leaf
 * with zero imports of its own, so reading it here cannot pull anything into
 * the build-time graph, and it means the compiler enforces one answer to
 * "which languages have pages" instead of two lists that can disagree.

   * language, that made a new page language cost the bundle 29 more strings -
   * measured at +3,351 B gz to reach eleven, against ~600 B of headroom.
   *
   * `src/content` is build-time only (`no-app-imports.test.ts` enforces it), so
   * a name here is read by the emitter and shipped to nobody. That is the whole
   * reason a page can now exist in a language the bundle has never heard of.
   *

   * which collides with the `id` field above and reds all 23 files with an
