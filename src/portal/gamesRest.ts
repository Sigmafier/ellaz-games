  // Wave 2 - the tap-the-moving-target cluster, all three on the shared
  // spawner (`@shared/spawn`). `bees` is the first game in the `speed`
  // section, which until then was declared in CATEGORY_ORDER but empty.
  balloons,
  bubbles,
  bees,
  frog,
  // `reaction` is the one Wave 2 game that does NOT use the shared spawner, on
  // purpose: there is a single light, it never moves and never expires, and the
  // quantity that matters is a timestamp - none of which the spawner models.
  reaction,

  // Wave 3 - the two mechanics the 2026 market data actually rewards, both
  // under `think`, both tap-only and both readable without a word of text.
  // `sort` is a finite puzzle that ends; `merge` is an endless climb, so their
  // reward shapes differ (`level_complete` vs `milestone` + a latched
  // `personal_best`) even though they arrived together.
  sort,
  merge,

  // Wave 4 - the two the 2026 market data rewards that Wave 3 did not cover:
  // something to come back TO rather than finish, and a calm placement puzzle
  // to sit beside the falling-block one. Both tap-only.
  //
  // `pet` is the first game here with no failure state at all - it cannot get
  // sick, hungry or sad however long it is left, which is why its record only
  // counts how big it has grown and can never go down. `fit` shares only
  // "polyomino on a grid" with `blocks`: nothing falls, nothing is timed, and
  // columns clear as well as rows, which is the comparison written into the
  // head of its own `logic.ts` so nobody re-derives it.
  //
  // Appended, so both land in the LAZY half of the card art by construction -
  // see `SHELL_ART_COUNT` in `src/ui/gameArt.ts`. That is the whole reason a new
  // game no longer costs the first visit its picture.
  pet,
  fit,

  // Wave 5. `music` is the FIRST game ever in the `create` category - that
  // section has been declared in CATEGORY_ORDER since the beginning and has
  // never rendered, because nothing was in it. `maze` is the first game about
  // planning a route: a tap names a DESTINATION and the mouse walks it, so the
  // difficulty is choosing an order rather than hitting a small square.
  //
  // Appended like every wave before it, so both land in the lazy half of the
  // card art and neither costs the first visit its picture.
  music,
  maze,

  // Wave 6. `letters` is the FIRST game ever in the `learn` category - declared
  // in CATEGORY_ORDER from the start and never rendered, exactly as `create`
  // waited for `music` and `speed` for `bees`. A picture is shown and the child
  // taps the letter its word begins with; an in-game toggle switches the letters
  // between languages, so a Hebrew reader can practise the English alphabet
  // without changing the interface. Appended, so its card art stays lazy.
  letters,

  // Wave 7. `spell` is the second game in `learn` and the step up from
  // `letters`: the same picture-first design and the same content-language
  // toggle, but the child builds the WHOLE word from a tray of tiles rather
  // than choosing its first letter. A wrong tile is never placed, so the word
  // on screen is correct at every moment, and a hint button fills the first
  // letter still unknown - the way out of being stuck, which a four-year-old
  // needs more than they need a score. Appended, so its card art stays lazy.
  spell,

  // Wave 8. `bubbleshooter` is the arcade shape this catalogue had no answer to:
  // the only game here where a shot TRAVELS, bounces off a wall and lands
  // somewhere the player predicted. It is the second game in `classics` to be
  // drawn on a canvas and the FIRST to do it with no engine at all - a full
  // board is 115 circles, three orders of magnitude under where sprite batching
  // starts to pay, and `logic.ts` solves each shot in one call rather than
  // stepping a simulation, so there is no fixed timestep to match a display to.
  // Appended, so its card art stays lazy.
  bubbleshooter,

  // Wave 9. `match3` is the swap-three shape - the most recognised casual
  // mechanic there is, and the one this catalogue had no answer to: `merge`
  // combines two into one and `bubbleshooter` fires at a ceiling, but nothing
  // here let a child trade two neighbours and watch a column fall. It is a
  // kids game rather than a classic because there is no clock and no way to
  // lose: the board is guaranteed to always hold a legal move, so the only
  // thing a round asks for is looking. Appended, so its card art stays lazy.
  match3,

  // Wave 9. `jigsaw` cuts this catalogue's OWN key art into pieces, which is
  // why it needed no new drawing: every scene is already built from one shared
  // vocabulary and already in the shell, so the game costs a picture list and
  // nothing else. Tap a piece, tap where it goes - a wrong space accepts the
  // piece, because trying one somewhere and seeing that it does not belong IS
  // the puzzle. Appended, so its card art stays lazy.
  jigsaw,
  // Wave 10. `lettercross` is a crossword tile game - lay letters, every run of two
  // or more has to be a word. Its dictionary is a lazy chunk of its own, so the
  // 28,515 words cost a first visit nothing; only this metadata row does.
  // Appended, so its card art stays lazy too. See src/games/lettercross/NOTICE.md for
  // where the word list comes from and what the name risks.
  lettercross,
  flow,
  arrowtap,
  fruit,
  parking,

  // Wave 11. Four puzzles, and the thing they share is that none of them can
  // deal a board nobody could finish: `nonogram` proves its clues force exactly
  // one picture by LINE-SOLVING them (a puzzle needing a guess is thrown away
  // and re-dealt), `onestroke` folds a walk that already visits every square,
  // `wordsearch` plants every listed word before a single filler letter, and
  // `untangle` joins its dots without a crossing and only then scatters them.
  // Built backwards from a solved state, four more times, for the reason
  // written at the top of `flow`: a budgeted SEARCH cannot tell "impossible"
  // from "merely deep", and it reports both as "no solution found".
  //
  // Appended like every wave before, so all four land in the lazy half of the
  // metadata and of the card art by construction.
  nonogram,
  onestroke,
  wordsearch,
  untangle,

  // Wave 12. `survivors` is the first ACTION game here - the first where the
  // danger moves on its own and the clock is the opponent. It is also the second
  // game on Phaser, which is the whole reason it was affordable: the engine is
  // already a lazy chunk snake pays for, so this costs its own code and nothing
  // else. You do not aim and you do not fire; the ship does that, and the only
  // thing asked of a player is where to stand. Appended like every wave before,
  // so its metadata and its card art both land in the lazy half by construction.
  survivors,

  // Wave 13. The first two games here an ADULT would sit down to, and the first
  // that play BACK: both carry the whole official rules and a computer at three
  // strengths, or the person next to you. Appended like every wave before, so
  // their metadata and their card art both land in the lazy half by
  // construction rather than by anybody remembering.
  chess,
  backgammon,
  holdtheline,
  snakesurvivors,
  // The Snake family's third game: the same neon snake as a turn-based puzzle,
  // twelve fixed levels in two worlds. Appended, so its metadata and card art
  // land in the lazy half by construction.
