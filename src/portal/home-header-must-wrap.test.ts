/**
 * The home header must wrap, and the language button must be able to drop its
 * label.
 *
 * This row's width grows with the LANGUAGE LIST, which is the same shape as
 * .claude/rules/a-row-that-grows-with-the-catalog-must-wrap.md - both earlier
 * instances grew with the catalog instead. `Bahasa Indonesia` made the language
 * control 134px beside three 48px siblings, and measured at 390px the header
 * asked for 509px of a 350px box. All eleven languages overflowed at 320, 360
 * and 390.
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE SCAN AND NOT A RENDERED-WIDTH CHECK. Both checks that rule
 * recommends reported clean over this bug, for the same reason and in a NEW
 * way. `body.app-shell` is overflow:hidden so the document never widened -
 * documentElement.scrollWidth was exactly innerWidth in all 33 cells - and the
 * overflow instead became sideways scroll inside `.ellaz-scroll`, one level in.
 * The per-item clipping check found nothing either, because these children were
 * never squeezed: they were pushed bodily outside the box, where a
 * `scrollWidth > clientWidth` test on the item itself is 0. jsdom measures
 * nothing at all, so a render test here would assert even less than that.
 *
 * The scan is therefore the honest instrument, and its weakness is stated
 * rather than hidden: it proves the properties are PRESENT, not that the
 * layout is right. The layout was verified by driving a real browser at 320,
 * 360, 390 and 430 across all eleven languages, before and after.
