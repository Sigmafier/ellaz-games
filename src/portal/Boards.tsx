// The boards — the one screen where a child sees that other people are here.
//
// It is built around a rule rather than around a ranking: NO CHILD IS EVER
// SHOWN AS LAST. `standingView` in the SDK decides what may be said about a
// player's position, and this screen renders whichever of the three answers it
// gives back. Nothing here recomputes a position, and nothing here may.
//
// The names are two words from a fixed list, so a public board carries nothing
// a child typed and nothing that identifies them. That is what makes it safe to
// show at all, and it is why the name pool has no free-text escape hatch.
//
// TWO SCREENS, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE
// It opens on the player's own games as cards, each already carrying their
// best, and a tap opens that game's board. The single-page version it replaces
// laid every game out in one non-wrapping row: 1,410px of buttons inside a
// 390px phone, clipped by the frame's own `overflow: hidden`, with no scroll
// and no wrap — so 15 of 20 games were not merely awkward to reach, they were
// unreachable. Three identically-styled pill rows sat above it, none of them
// saying what they picked.
//
// The grid also earns the first screen: a control panel tells a player nothing
// until they operate it, while twenty cards with their own records on them are
// already an answer. And every board now has a way back INTO the game, which
// is the thing a leaderboard is for.
//
// WHICH BOARD, AND IN WHAT UNIT
// Both have to come from somewhere other than this file. A game scopes its
// record per difficulty inside its own renderer, which the portal can never
// import — so the boards a player HAS are read back out of their own record
// keys, and what the number MEASURES is read off the game's DOM-free meta,
// where `score-unit-declared.test.ts` pins it to the renderer. Guessing either
// one shows a fast time ranked as if slow were better.

// All time FIRST, and it is also the default every window row opens on. A
// board scoped to today is empty most of the time - a player who set their
// record last week opens the screen, reads a blank board, and the honest
// answer to "how am I doing" is one they never see. The narrower windows are
// the interesting question only once the broad one has been answered, so they
// come after it. `POOLED_WINDOWS` is this same list rather than a copy of it:
// two window rows that can disagree is a screen offering Today in one place
// and not the other, which is exactly the bug that shipped.

 *
 * And on the pixels: four `DifficultySelector` pills do not fit 358px of phone,

 * the width evenly (`flex: 1`, `minWidth: 0`) and carry no gaps, so the row is
 * one line at any width by construction rather than by a constant that goes
 * stale the day a fifth window is added.
