//
//   1. An ICON filter rail instead of stacked text sections. A pre-reader cannot
//      read "חשיבה", and at the full catalog the stacked-section layout ran to
//      about five phone screens of scrolling - measured, not guessed. Tapping a
//      picture cuts that to roughly one.
//   2. A FAVOURITE star in the corner of every card. It replaced the
//      stars-earned badge on 2026-09-23 (operator: "i dont know what it means
//      and i rather have a favorite button"); stars still show on the World
//      screen and the boards.
//   3. A KEEP PLAYING row, so returning needs no reading at all, and under it
//      a FAVOURITES row once anything is starred.
//   4. The WORLD as a hero card showing the real room, rather than a 48px button
//      in the corner. It is the reason to earn coins; it should look like it.

 * The four printable packs, in the trailing shelf, in Hebrew only.
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE AT ALL. The packs shipped on 2026-09-03 as ORPHANS - measured
 * on the live site that week, `/he/` served 47 anchors and `/he/games/kids/`
 * served 23, and none of the 70 pointed at a print page. `sitePages.ts` now
 * carries the crawler's half, but that block is REMOVED once React mounts, so
 * without this row a Hebrew visitor with JavaScript still cannot reach four
 * pages that return 200. Deleting either half re-orphans them for half the
 * audience.
 *
 * WHY THE TRAILING SHELF and not a card. A worksheet is printed by an adult, and
 * this shelf is already where the adult chrome lives - the install hint and the
 * report door are here for the reason spelled out on the reporter below. A card
 * in the grid would sit between a five-year-old and the games.
 *
 * WHY HEBREW-ONLY IS A LOCALE TEST AND NOT AN `APP_LOCALES` TEST. The packs are
 * addressed by PAGE locale; eleven app languages funnel down to four page
 * languages, and only one of those has these documents.
 *
 * WHY THE LABELS ARE LITERALS. They are not translations - there is nothing to
 * translate, because the pages exist in one language by a content decision. And
 * they are not catalogue lookups: only `SHELL_META_COUNT` games' metadata is in
 * the first visit, so `findEntry("wordsearch")` is undefined until the rest
 * arrives and this row would GROW under the reader. `printables-are-linked.test.tsx`
 * pins every one of them to the same `gameName(kind, "he")` the pack pages use,
 * so they cannot drift into saying something the target does not.

              Coins are this card's own subject: `RewardsPort` has no `spend()`

              whole app where a coin is spent. This line is that room's price
              tag.

              and pet_dragon gate on 5, 10 and 20 of them - so the tidy story
              ("the room has nothing to do with stars") would be false. They

              `<WalletChip bare />`, which draws coins AND stars, and a locked

/**
 * "This game is still being built", on the card, before the player taps it.
 *
 * ONE WORD, AND THE PAGE CARRIES THE SENTENCE. The badge on the game's own
 * page reads "Beta" with the whole translated note beside it for a screen
 * reader, and that costs a first visit NOTHING because `src/build` ships to
 * nobody. Here, every character is in the shell chunk every child downloads
 * before choosing anything - so this one says the word and stops, and the
 * explanation waits for the page the tap leads to. Measured: the sentence in
 * three languages plus a title, an aria-label and a role was 293 B gz; the
 * word alone is a fraction of it, on a budget with about five games of room.
 *
 * The word is INLINE rather than an i18n key for the same reason: `makeT` keys
 * ride in all eleven lazy locale chunks, `textFor` reads three strings once.
 *
 * It is on the GRID card and nowhere else among the three. The daily card and
 * the keep-playing rail are both about a game the player has already met - and
 * the game's own PAGE carries the badge whatever route they arrived by, which
 * is the guarantee that actually matters. This one is the courtesy of saying
 * so before they spend a tap.
 *
 * No `dir` here, unlike the star badge beside it: that one pins LTR because it
 * holds a DIGIT next to a glyph and the pair reorders, while this is one word
 * with no digits, which renders the same either way - and pinning LTR would be
 * pinning the wrong direction for the Hebrew word.
