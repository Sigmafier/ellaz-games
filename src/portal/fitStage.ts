/**
 * Scale a mounted game so the whole of it fits the screen it was given.
 *
 * WHY THIS HAS TO EXIST AT ALL
 * Every game sizes its board against the VIEWPORT - `min(90vw, 60vh, cap)` -
 * and then stacks its stats row, its difficulty row and sometimes a keypad on
 * top of that. So the total is always TALLER than the window the board just
 * measured itself against. On a 1536x638 window, 2048 asks for 680px. Nothing
 * the frame does can talk it out of that, because the game never consulted the
 * frame.
 *
 * The old answer was to let the stage grow, which is why nothing was ever cut
 * off and why the bottom of the game sat below the fold. The full-screen stage
 * is a fixed 100dvh with `overflow: hidden`, so growing is no longer on the
 * table: without this module a tall game would be CLIPPED, which is strictly
 * worse than the scroll it replaced.
 *
 * Scaling the mounted result is the one lever that reaches all 21 games without
 * editing any of them.
 *
 * The transform goes on `#game-frame` - the element the build emits and React
 * merely mounts INTO. React owns that element's children and never its style,
 * so this cannot fight the reconciler.

/**
 * Below this, scaling costs more than it buys.
 *
 * The kids games carry a 2cm minimum tap target, and a scale multiplies that
 * straight through: 2cm at 0.65 is 1.3cm, which a five-year-old on a phone
 * genuinely cannot hit. So rather than shrink past it we release the fixed
 * height and let the page scroll, which is what it did before any of this -
 * worse framing, but nothing lost and nothing unreachable.
