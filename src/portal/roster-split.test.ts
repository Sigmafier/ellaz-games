/**
 * The roster is split across three files so a first visit stops carrying a
 * record per game, and three files holding one ordering is exactly how an
 * ordering drifts. This is the pin.
 *
 * Every assertion here fails LOUDLY. The failure this guards against does not:
 * a game that slips from `shellRoster.ts` into `gamesRest.ts` renders perfectly,
 * ships a smaller shell, and simply pops in a beat later than it should - and one
 * that slips the other way renders perfectly too and quietly charges every child
 * for a card they will never scroll to. Neither shows up as an error anywhere.
