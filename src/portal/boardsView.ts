// The pure half of the boards screen.

// It exists so the screen can be looked at without a browser: which games a
// player sees, which boards each one has, and which number a card is entitled

/**
 * Every rung of every ladder in the catalogue, easiest first.
 *
 * Boards used to be sorted with a bare `.sort()`, which is alphabetical, so
 * sudoku's difficulty pills read Easy / Hard / Med and snake's card opened on
 * `fast` - an order nobody chose, and one that reads as a bug rather than as a
 * scale. A ladder is an ORDER, and the only place that order exists is the
 * `DifficultyOption[]` each renderer declares, which is source this module
 * cannot import: `boardsView` is pure and `Sudoku.tsx` is a component.
 *
 * So the order is restated here and PINNED to those declarations by
 * `boardsView.test.ts`, which reads the games tree and fails when a rung is
 * missing or out of sequence. The alternative - `levels` on the DOM-free
 * `meta.ts`, derived rather than restated - is the right end state and costs
 * shell bytes on a roster imported statically by the home grid, so it is not
 * this change.
 *
 * The six ladders fold into one list without contradicting each other, which is
 * what makes a single list possible at all: `medium` is the middle rung of both
 * easy/medium/hard and short/medium/long, and `normal` the middle of both
 * easy/normal/hard and slow/normal/fast. No id sits at two different heights.
 *
 * `pip`/`mo`/`tuli` are not difficulties - they are which pet you chose - but
 * they are board ids and they need an order, so they take the one `PETS`
 * declares rather than the alphabetical one.
