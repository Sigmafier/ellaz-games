/**
 * The lazy loader for each game ABOVE THE FOLD. The rest live beside their
 * metadata in `gamesRest.ts`.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SPLIT. The 38 chunk NAMES alone measured 431 B gz - 13.1 B per
 * game - and the loader expressions around them another 649 B, which was most
 * of the per-game slope that survived the metadata split. A loader is a string
 * and an arrow function; it is not free, and the comment on `loaderFor` below
 * said it was until somebody measured it.
 *
 * Nothing needs the below-the-fold half before `gamesRest` lands: `findEntry`
 * and `dailyRotation` read `ROSTER_IDS`, and `entryFor` - the only path that
 * MOUNTS a game - already awaits `ensureFullCatalog()`. So the split costs no
 * extra request: the chunk that carries the metadata carries the loader too.
