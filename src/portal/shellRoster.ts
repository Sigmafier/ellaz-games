/**
 * The roster the SHELL carries: every game's id, and full metadata for only the
 * games a visitor can see before scrolling.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `games.ts` imported all 33 `meta.ts` files statically so
 * the home grid could render without pulling any game code. That worked and it
 * made the first visit grow with the catalogue: measured on the served artifact
 * 2026-08-21, the metadata is ~91 B gz per game - `title` alone is 28.5 - paid by
 * every child, for cards most of them never scroll to. Pruning the five fields
 * the grid never reads (`ageBand`, `orientation`, `renderer`, `ownsChrome`,
 * `scoreUnit`) recovers 181 B in total, which does not buy even one game. The
 * only route to an O(1) first visit is that the shell stops carrying a RECORD per
 * game, which is what this file does.
 *
 * WHY THE IDS ARE STILL ALL HERE, as a plain string list. The grid lays out one
 * card per id immediately, so the page does not REFLOW when the rest arrive - the
 * cards below the fold simply fill in their label and colour, the same beat the
 * card art already has. 33 ids compress to a couple of bytes each; 33 records do
 * not. A game added below the fold therefore costs the shell its id and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN IS NOT A JUDGEMENT CALL. `SHELL_META_COUNT` must equal
 * `SHELL_ART_COUNT` in `src/ui/gameArt.ts` - the same question ("what is above
 * the fold") must not have two answers - and `roster-split.test.ts` fails the
 * build if they disagree, if `ROSTER_IDS` stops matching the full roster, or if
 * `gamesRest.ts` stops holding exactly the remainder.
