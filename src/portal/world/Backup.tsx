// The backup card — the one place this app talks to a grown-up.
//
// It sits at the BOTTOM of the World, under the shop, because it is not part of
// playing. A child never needs it; a parent setting up a second tablet, or
// recovering after a wipe, does.
//
// The copy does not pretend to be magic. There is no account, no email and no
// password, so the code IS the only way back — and a feature whose failure mode
// is "your child's room is gone forever" has to say what it needs, plainly,
// before it is needed.
//
// Two things here exist because the honest version of each is not the obvious
// one:
//
//   A CODE IS NOT OFFERED UNTIL A SAVE ACTUALLY LANDED. A backup code is
//   generated locally, so it exists whether or not anything reached the cloud.
//   Printing it the moment we have it would hand a parent a code to write on a
//   Post-it that restores nothing, and they would find that out on the one day
//   it mattered. So the save is awaited, and a failure says so and offers a
//   retry instead of a confident string of characters.
//
//   RESTORING SHOWS BOTH SIDES AND CAN BE TAKEN BACK. It is the only
//   destructive action in the app: look up the code, SEE what is arriving
//   AND what is here now, then confirm. Even then the replaced profile is kept,
//   so the parent who was holding the wrong tablet has a way back.
