   * `daily.ts` can reduce, so a broken streak costs a child nothing at all.
   *
   * A gated item still costs coins. The streak buys ACCESS, never the item —

   * in the wallet somewhere new to go rather than adding more of them.

/**
 * THE STREAK SHELF — the three things only coming back day after day unlocks.
 *
 * They are ordinary catalogue rows in every other respect: permanent ids, a
 * coin price, a category that already exists. What they are not is buyable by
 * any other route. There is no star count, no amount of play in one sitting and
 * no number of wins that opens them; the only key is a run of days.
 *
 * PRICED, NOT GIVEN, and that is the answer to the inflation question. The shop
 * is the only coin sink in this app, so the risk of a daily reward was always
 * that it prints currency into a bucket with a fixed bottom. A shelf does the
 * opposite: it deepens the bucket. A child with a fortnight's streak has three
 * new things to want, bought with coins they already had.
 *
 * The rungs match `STREAK_MILESTONES` in `daily.ts` on purpose — day 3, day 7,
 * day 14 — so the day a milestone pays is the day something new appears in the
 * shop. They are two lists rather than one because they answer different
 * questions ("when does a streak pay" versus "what does it open"), and
 * `items.test.ts` pins that the shelf's rungs are real rungs of that ladder.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM `ITEMS` because it is keyed by its own art-id union and drawn
 * by its own map, `streakArt.tsx`. Both halves ship in the SHELL, so the split
 * costs nothing and buys a per-half `tsc` exhaustiveness check.
