/**
 * A pause button is only as good as what it stops.
 *
 * Three ways to ship one that looks perfect and is wrong, and none of them is
 * loud - the cover draws, the icon flips, the game reports itself paused:
 *
 * 1. THE CLOCK KEEPS RUNNING. The cover hides the board, so nobody sees the
 *    piece fall or the snake set off. The player lifts the lid onto a game they
 *    have already lost.
 * 2. THE INPUT STAYS LIVE. The chrome's cover sits over the PLAY SURFACE, and
 *    every steering control in both of these games is in the FOOTER below it.
 *    So the pad and the keyboard go on working behind the cover, moving a piece
 *    the player cannot see.
 * 3. THE PORTAL'S RESUME CLEARS THE PLAYER'S PAUSE. `ctx.onResume` fires when a
 *    backgrounded tab comes back. If it writes the same flag the button does,
 *    then pausing, switching apps and returning starts the game under a cover
 *    the player never dismissed - the exact combination a "put the tablet down"
 *    control exists to serve.
 *
 * This is a source scan for the same reason the chrome test next door is: the
 * suite runs `environment: "node"` and cannot mount a component, and the Phaser
 * scene cannot be constructed without an engine and a canvas.
