/**
 * A one-bubble gap was always legal to shoot through, and never possible to
 * aim at.
 *
 * Reported 2026-09-04, issue #29: "When a bubble is shot exactly between 2
 * bubbles that have a bubble space around them, It should squeeze inside the 2
 * bubbles and pass between them like in the original bubbles game, with
 * squashing animation."
 *
 * They were describing something the geometry already allowed. A resting bubble
 * is 1.0 wide and so is a flying one, so the hole left by one missing bubble is
 * a ZERO-CLEARANCE fit - and `HIT_DIST` was 0.92, which buys 0.08 of a bubble
 * either side. Measured on the shipped build, with controls passing
 * (`scripts/repro/bubbleshooter-squeeze-window.mts`): the widest angle window
 * that got past a one-cell gap was 19.04 mrad, 0.70% of the aim arc, about
 * **2.5 px of finger travel on a 360 px drag**. Legal, and unhittable.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE HOLDS, and the middle two are the ones that matter:
 *
 *   1. a sealed wall still stops everything - the fix must not become a hole
 *      in every collision on the board;
 *   2. a one-cell gap is now threadable by a person, not by luck;
 *   3. ...and the widening is BOUNDED - a wall with no gap is unchanged, so the
 *      number in cell 1 is what proves cell 2 is not just "collisions got
 *      worse";
 *   4. the shot REPORTS the squeeze, so the renderer can squash the bubble
 *      rather than the renderer guessing where to;
 *   5. the ceiling is not a corridor - a bubble that reaches row 0 lands there
 *      and never leaves the top of the board;
 *   6. `aim()` is still pure and total: same board, same angle, same answer,
 *      which is what lets the guide and the shot come from one call.
 *
 * These are real assertions against the real module. No DOM, no source
 * scanning: everything here is `logic.ts` answering questions.
