/**
 * `ownsChrome` in a game's meta and `<GameChrome>` in its renderer are two
 * halves of one decision, and they live in two files that nothing else forces
 * to agree. Getting either half alone is silent and unpleasant:
 *
 * - meta says `ownsChrome`, renderer does not use GameChrome -> `GameHost`
 *   stops drawing its bar and the player has NO WAY HOME. The game still plays
 *   perfectly, which is why nobody would notice until a child is stuck in it.
 * - renderer uses GameChrome, meta does not say `ownsChrome` -> both bars draw,
 *   so the screen has two mute buttons and two ways back. That reads as a bug
 *   rather than as emphasis, and it is exactly what the flag exists to prevent.
 *
 * Neither shows up in `tsc`, in any unit test, or in a screenshot of the one
 * game somebody happened to open. So it is pinned here, by reading each game's
 * own source - the same technique `score-unit-declared.test.ts` uses, and for
 * the same reason: the catalog cannot import a renderer without pulling React
 * into a DOM-free module.

 * no way home. A showcase game wearing `<ArcadeChrome>` draws one; it simply
 * draws a different one. Keying on the single name `GameChrome` would have
 * turned that into a build failure for doing the thing the arcade HUD exists to
 * do, and the temptation then is to weaken the assertion instead of the
 * matcher - which would stop catching a game that renders NEITHER, the only
 * case that ever mattered.
