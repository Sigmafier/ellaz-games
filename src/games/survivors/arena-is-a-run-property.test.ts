/**
 * The arena is a property of the RUN, not a constant of the module.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until 2026-09-13 `ARENA` was one module constant and
 * every part of the simulation read it directly. The operator ruled the arena
 * LANDSCAPE on a PC, which means two shapes have to coexist - and the way that
 * change goes wrong is not a crash. Leave any ONE of the old reads behind and
 * the game still boots, still draws, still plays: the canvas is the new shape,
 * the floor underneath it is the old one. Enemies walk in from a line down the
 * middle of the screen, or the ship stops dead 420 units from the left with a
 * third of the arena it can never reach. Nothing throws and nothing logs.
 *
 * So the behavioural tests below drive the WIDE arena specifically and assert
 * things that are impossible on the portrait one. A test that passed on both
 * shapes could not have caught the bug it is here for.
 *
 * EVERY CHECK CARRIES ITS OWN MUTATION, per the house rule: a source scan that
 * has never been watched failing is indistinguishable from one whose regex
 * stopped matching.
