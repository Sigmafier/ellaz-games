// WHY THIS FILE IS WORTH ITS BYTES. The stick replaces the four-arrow pad as the
// ONLY way a phone player steers this game, so every defect here is a game that
// cannot be played at all rather than one that plays badly. The first test below
// covers the failure that would do it: a thumb resting exactly on the stick's
// origin divides by zero, and a NaN in the steering vector puts the robot at
// NaN,NaN - off the board, unrecoverable, on the FIRST frame of every tap.
