// The two powers: a dash that fires by itself, and a freeze on the one button.

// Operator ruling 2026-09-14, picked off mocks drawn over the live game. Freeze
// is the super: it charges as gems are collected and one tap stops every shape
// for two seconds. Dash is automatic: when a shape would cost a heart and the
// dash is ready, the robot blinks away from it instead, and the dash recharges.
//
// Types only from `logic.ts`, so there is no import cycle.
