/**
 * Match Three's power-ups: made by the SHAPE of a match, fired when they GO.
 *
 * Asked for 2026-09-04 (issue #24): "the candy crash super powers". The point
 * of this design is that there is no new input, no new gesture and nothing a
 * five-year-old has to be taught. You match, and sometimes the board does
 * something bigger. A gem's KIND is decided by the shape that made it and it
 * fires when it is cleared - never by being tapped.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE HOLDS, and every cell is a thing that was wrong or could be:
 *
 *   the SHAPE     - 3 mints nothing, 4 a stripe along the run, 5 a rainbow,
 *                   an L or T a burst at its intersection, and a cross whose
 *                   long arm is five is a RAINBOW rather than a burst;
 *   the BLAST     - a stripe takes its line, a burst its 3x3, a rainbow every
 *                   gem of its colour, and a blast that catches another
 *                   special fires that one too, to a fixed point;
 *   the CARRYING  - the kind travels with its gem through a swap, through
 *                   gravity, and through a shuffle;
 *   the REPORTING - `spawned` names the square the minted gem LANDED on, and
 *                   a special that merely fell is not reported as minted;
 *   the OLD RULES - `findMatches`, `hasMove` and `dealBoard` reason about
 *                   colour alone and are the same code they were.
 *
 * Every fixture here was built by hand and is PROVEN to have no pre-existing
 * match before it is used, because a fixture that is already matching measures
 * the settle loop rather than the cell it was written for.
