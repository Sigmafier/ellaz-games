// The repo has asserted "logic.ts is pure - no DOM/Phaser imports" since day
// one, in CLAUDE.md, and nothing enforced it. This is that enforcement.
//
// It is not style policing. A pure logic module that reaches React or `@ui`
// (which imports global.css as a side effect) stops being unit-testable in the
// node environment vitest runs in, and drags a renderer into every consumer's
// bundle. The failure is silent: everything still builds and passes.
//
// The `@shared` BARREL is banned here for exactly that reason - it re-exports
// Prompt (React) and useGameTimer, so `import { pick } from "@shared"` inside a
// logic module quietly pulls React in. Import the direct module instead
// (`@shared/rng`, `@shared/cast`). Renderers may use the barrel freely.
