/**
 * The maze's cell cap times its widest board must clear the desktop panel.
 *
 * `game-panel-clears-widest-board.test.ts` reads every game's `min(...)` px
 * ceilings and compares them against `.ellaz-game-panel`'s 700px cap. It is
 * blind to this game by construction: maze sizes a CELL, not a board, so the
 * number it reads is one square and the board is that many times wider. It
 * reported 76 while the board was 8 x 76 = 608, and it would go on reporting 76
 * at any board size - the exact "instrument that cannot represent the thing it
 * is looking for" shape as
 * `.claude/rules/a-diagnostic-that-truncates-what-it-compares.md`.
 *
 * That blindness cost nothing while the widest board was seven cells. The
 * expert board is TEN, and 10 x 76 = 760px against the 684px the panel leaves -
 * an oversized board does not throw or spill, it grows a scrollbar inside a
 * play surface that is `overflow: auto`, which reads as "this game is a bit
 * awkward on desktop" rather than as a regression anybody files.
 *
 * So the cap is 64, and until 2026-09-14 this asserted it against the panel cap
 * read out of the shipped stylesheet. See below for what it asserts now.
 */

/*
 * 2026-09-14: the panel lost its px cap (`.ellaz-game-panel { max-width: none }`
 * on a PC, operator: "use the entire width of the PC screen"), so the number
 * this file used to read out of `global.css` is gone and its old assertion read
 * `-16px` of usable width. What replaced it is the reason it is safe: on a PC
 * the maze no longer sizes a CELL at all. The whole board is `.ellaz-board`,
 * bounded by the height the window leaves and the width beside the footer
 * column, and a cell is one `1fr` track of it. The cell cap now governs the
 * PHONE arm only - and since the same day it is a 640px BOARD cap divided per
 * cell, so the easy board is not the one grid that stops short.
 *
 * So this asserts both halves: the phone arm's widest board still clears the
 * desktop ceiling every `boardVars` board is held to, and the PC arm really is
 * routed through the policy rather than through the cell cap.
