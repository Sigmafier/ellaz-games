/**
 * The record is written every turn, and the reward is paid once per run.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `isOver` is bag-empty AND rack-empty, and a tile leaves the
 * rack only by being placed on the board. With more tiles in the bag than
 * squares on the board, some tiles can never be placed, so `isOver` is false
 * for ever - and it used to be the ONLY path that reported a score. The game
 * kept no record at all and showed "Best -" whatever anybody did.
 *
 * Every assertion here is a SOURCE read, because this repo has no DOM harness
 * for a game renderer. A source read is weaker than driving the component, so
 * each matcher is proved able to fire before its absence is allowed to mean
 * anything - a regex that quietly stops matching reports a clean sweep over
 * code it never looked at.
