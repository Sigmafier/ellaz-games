/**
 * What the board is FOR, since 2026-08-24. The operator, verbatim:
 *
 *   "user should put any word they want anywhere, also we dont need the color
 *    blocks, all should be placeable. also i dont need the bonus or special
 *    boxes."
 *
 * Three rules were removed that day - the centre start, the connection
 * requirement, and every premium square. Two of the tests in `logic.test.ts`
 * used to assert the opposite of what this file asserts, and they were FLIPPED
 * rather than deleted, so a rule creeping back has something to break.
 *
 * This file exists for the fourth thing, which is not a removal but the hole
 * the removals opened: with nothing left to enforce WHERE a tile goes, a single
 * tile went anywhere for zero points. See the last block.

 * column are not its index. Written out again here it would be a second place
 * to be wrong.
