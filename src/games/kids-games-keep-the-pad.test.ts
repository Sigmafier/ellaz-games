/**
 * A kids-band game never ships the stick alone.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. On 2026-09-13 the operator ruled that the
 * steering moves ONTO the arena for `survivors`, and the law in `CLAUDE.md` was
 * narrowed in the same change: what used to bind every game now binds only
 * `ageBand: "kids"`. A narrowed law with nothing enforcing it is not a narrower
 * law - it is a deleted law with a paragraph where it stood, and this repo
 * already collects that failure ("a claim about a SET goes in a test, not a
 * sentence"). So the narrowing ships with its own gate.
 *
 * The thing being protected is not tidiness. A five-year-old on a phone, and
 * anyone on assistive input, cannot hold a sustained pointer gesture; the four
 * arrows are what make a kids game completable without one. A joystick is a
 * sustained drag by definition.

 * extensions rather than of games. `survivors` steers from `SurvivorsScene.ts`,
 * a Phaser class in a plain `.ts`; the only reason this saw its stick at all was
 * a `StickStyle` type import that happened to sit in the `.tsx`. Removing the
 * Controls picker removed that import, and the cell below went red saying
 * "survivors is the game that grew a stick: expected false to be true" - about a
 * game that still has exactly one stick and always did.
 *
 * A scan that answers "does this game import X" must read every file the game
 * could import X from. `meta.ts` and `logic.ts` are swept in too and cost
 * nothing: neither may import a control, and if one ever did, being caught here
 * is the right outcome.
