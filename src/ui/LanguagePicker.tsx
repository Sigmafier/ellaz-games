/**
 * The language control.
 *
 * A button that opens a wrapping sheet of every language the app speaks, each
 * written in ITSELF. It replaced a two-state `EN / עב` toggle, which stops being
 * a control the moment there are more than two languages.
 *
 * THREE DECISIONS, none of them cosmetic:
 *
 * 1. AUTONYMS, NEVER FLAGS. A flag is a country, not a language - Spanish is not
 *    Spain, Portuguese is mostly not Portugal, Arabic is spoken across twenty-odd
 *    states. On this site specifically, an Israeli flag beside an Arabic one is a
 *    political statement a children's game platform has no business making. And
 *    "Spanish" written in English is unreadable to exactly the person who needs
 *    it most, which is why every entry is written in its own language.
 *
 * 2. IT WRAPS. Twelve items today and the list only grows. A non-wrapping flex
 *    row inside a container with `overflow: hidden` does not scroll - it CLIPS,
 *    silently, on the narrow screens most children actually use. This repo has
 *    paid for that twice already; see
 *    .claude/rules/a-row-that-grows-with-the-catalog-must-wrap.md.
 *
 * 3. THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IS MARKED BY SHAPE, NOT COLOUR. A ring plus a check
 *    glyph, so it reads for a colour-blind parent and in a screenshot.
 *
 * 4. THE BUTTON IS A GLOBE AT EVERY WIDTH. It used to carry the autonym above
 *    430px and hide it below, through an `.ellaz-lang-label` class the
 *    stylesheet owned. Operator ruling 2026-08-24, verbatim: "always show
 *    language as globe icon but it must be there". So there is no label, no
 *    class and no media query - one control, one appearance, everywhere.
 *
 *    "But it must be there" is the load-bearing half, and it is why this
 *    control is never folded behind a settings button. Measured that day: the
 *    four home shells (`/`, `/he/`, `/es/`, `/fr/`) emit NO language offer bar
 *    - 0 hits against 7 on every content page, because they render no
 *    DOCUMENT_CSS - so on those four pages THIS is the only language
 *    affordance in existence. `/` is also the canonical entry and the
 *    x-default target, and `storedLocale()` answers a first visit in English
 *    by design, while Search Console says 76% of the queries reaching this
 *    site are Hebrew. Hiding this button hides the way out.
 *
 *    The name is not lost with the label: `aria-label` carries it, in the
 *    "Theme: Night" shape the sibling toggles already use, and the sheet it
 *    opens still writes every language in itself.
 *
 * Each entry carries its own `dir` and `lang`, so an Arabic autonym renders
 * right-to-left inside an otherwise left-to-right sheet. Without that, the label
 * of the language somebody is looking for is the one label rendered wrongly.
