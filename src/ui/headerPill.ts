/**
 * The round 48px control in the home bar. ONE object, because there were four.
 *
 * The trophy, the globe and the theme toggle were three hand-written style
 * blocks agreeing on nine declarations and disagreeing on three - and the one
 * that disagreed on `display` is the reason this file exists. `ThemeToggle`
 * omitted `display/alignItems/justifyContent`, so its `<svg>` laid out as
 * inline text at the START of a block box: measured on the live site, the moon
 * sat **15px left of the button's centre**, at 320px and at 1440px alike, while
 * its two neighbours were dead centre. Reported by the operator, not by any
 * gate here - a glyph off-centre inside a correctly-sized button is invisible
 * to every check this repo owns.
 *
 * Three copies is not a duplication problem, it is a DRIFT problem: the fourth
 * one would have drifted too, and the defect only ever shows up as "that button
 * looks a bit odd". Sharing the object makes it unrepresentable rather than
 * merely fixed, and `header-pills-are-one-shape.test.ts` refuses a fourth copy.
 *
 * A plain object rather than a class, because these three are React inline
 * styles today and a class would need `global.css` to own a name that the
 * emitted document pages also carry - two owners for one shape.
