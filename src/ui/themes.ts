 *
 * - `index.html`, the application shell. It has no boot script of its own, so
 *   the Vite plugin is the only thing that gives it one.
 * - An emitted page. `renderDocument` already inlines the script as the first
 *   thing in its head - it has to, because those files are written straight to
 *   disk in `generateBundle` and never pass through a transform at all.
 *
 * In production the two never meet. In DEV they do: emitted pages are served
 * through `server.transformIndexHtml` (they must be - see
 * `.claude/rules/dev-pages-must-go-through-vites-html-pipeline.md`), so without
 * this predicate every dev page would carry the script twice. Running twice is
 * harmless today, because the script only reads storage and sets an attribute.
 * The reason to fix it anyway is that "harmless today" is a property of the
 * script's current body, not of the arrangement - and dev quietly serving
 * something production does not is exactly the divergence this repo keeps
 * getting bitten by.
 *
 * Matched on the storage key rather than the whole script: the key is the one
 * part no rewrite of the boot logic can drop, and it appears nowhere else in a
 * document.
