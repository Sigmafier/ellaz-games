/**
 * The desktop panel cap must stay wider than the widest board any game asks for.
 *
 * `.ellaz-game-panel` has NO width cap above 900px of viewport since 2026-09-14
 * (operator: "use the entire width of the PC screen"), and its ROW (`.gc-head`, the footer) at 700px - the row cap is what stopped
 * the difficulty toggle rendering 1193px wide. Until 2026-09-14 the 700px sat on
 * the whole panel and capped every board with it; the operator ruled every game
 * gets a PC version, so it moved to the only thing it was ever measured for. A cap is a
 * promise about OTHER people's code though: it is correct only for as long as
 * no game asks for more room than it leaves, and the game that breaks it will
 * be written months from now by someone who has never read that CSS.
 *
 * The failure would also be quiet. The play surface is `overflow: auto`, so an
 * oversized board does not spill and does not throw - it grows a scrollbar
 * inside the panel, which reads as "this game is a bit awkward on desktop"
 * rather than as a regression anyone files.
 *
 * So this reads the game TREE rather than a list, the same way
 * `game-art.test.ts` does. A game added tomorrow is covered with no edit here,
 * and one that asks for 720px fails the build with the number it needs.
