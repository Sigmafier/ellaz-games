/**
 * The three round controls in the home bar are ONE object, not three copies.
 *
 * Origin: the operator, 2026-08-25 - "the dark/light mode button is not
 * centered in homepage". Measured on the live site, at 320px and at 1440px
 * alike, comparing the four siblings:
 *
 *     Leaderboards   display:flex     glyph dx =   0
 *     Language       display:flex     glyph dx =   0
 *     Theme: Night   display:block    glyph dx = -15    <- the odd one out
 *     CardStyle      display:flex     (centred, in the rail)
 *
 * `ThemeToggle` was the only one of three hand-written style blocks that
 * omitted `display/alignItems/justifyContent`, so its `<svg>` laid out as an
 * inline child at the start of a block box. Nine declarations agreed and three
 * did not, which is what three copies of one shape always end in.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST AND NOT A GREP FOR "flex". A grep would have reported the
 * property PRESENT the moment the word appeared anywhere in the block, and
 * `display: block` winning by DEFAULT leaves no token to search for at all -
 * the defect is an absence. So this asserts the three call sites hand the
 * shared object over whole, and that the object itself still carries the three
 * declarations. A fourth copy is what it refuses.
