/**
 * The four-way pad, in three parts.
 *
 * 1. THE CROSS. Down sits BELOW left/right, not between them. That is the whole
 *    point of the shape and it is the one property a rendered-width check could
 *    never see - a pad laid out as the old two-row block is exactly as wide,
 *    exactly as tall per row, fully functional, and wrong.
 * 2. THE STICK. `padDirection` is the pure half, so the dead zone and the
 *    dominant-axis rule are testable without a DOM.
 * 3. NOBODY KEEPS A PRIVATE COPY. Two games hand-rolled the same `dpadBtn`
 *    before this component existed, which is how they came to disagree about
 *    cell size in the first place. A third copy would drift the same way.
