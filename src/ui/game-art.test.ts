// `gameArt.ts` now ships only the scenes above the fold and fetches the rest at
// runtime, so a file that imported it alone would check sixteen games and
// report full coverage - a coverage gate blind to the half of the catalogue it
// was written to watch. `game-art-split.test.ts` is what keeps the two halves
// honest about which scene belongs where; this file's job is unchanged, and it
// needs all of them.

/**
 * Every game has a picture, and this is the gate that says so.
 *
 * It exists because of a specific failure. The 21 scenes were drawn and
 * approved on 2026-08-03 and recorded in the plan under "reused, not
 * reinvented" - a line, not a task. Nothing owned it and nothing checked it, so
 * the site shipped every game as one operating-system emoji on a colour block,
 * and two cards on the home grid were the same snake. Every gate in this repo
 * reported green throughout: they count words, resolve links, parse JSON-LD,
 * bound the precache and diff the sitemap. Not one of them looked at whether a
 * game had a picture.
 *
 * So this reads the game tree, not a list. A game added tomorrow appears here
 * with no edit, which is the only way a coverage check stays true.
