/**
 * Does this card draw its scene right now?
 *
 * ONE predicate, because more than one caller needs the answer and they need
 * the SAME answer: `GameArt` picks what to render, and a card decides whether
 * to lay the `.ellaz-tint` wash behind it. Let those drift and you get a card
 * washing a picture that already has its own ground - mud - or an emoji sitting
 * on bare card stock with nothing behind it.
 *
 * THERE IS NO LONGER A PLAYER-FACING CHOICE HERE, and that is the point. This
 * took a `CardStyle` until 2026-09-12: a chip in the rail flipped every card to
 * the emoji and STORED it, so one accidental tap turned the drawings off for
 * good. The operator hit it on their own site and could not find the way back -
 * the chip sat among the CATEGORY filters and, once tapped, wore the same 🎨
 * glyph as the real `Create` category with nothing on screen saying "undo". A
 * preference nobody can reverse is a trap, not a preference, so the drawings
 * are simply what a card shows.
 *
 * The emoji survives as the FALLBACK and only that: a game whose scene has not
 * arrived yet, or one added later and not yet drawn. `ellaz:cards` in a
 * player's storage is now read by nothing, so anyone stranded on the emoji by
 * that chip gets their pictures back on the next load, with no migration.
 *
 * `hasArt` answers for the LAZY half as well, and that is load-bearing here
 * rather than a nicety. The home grid calls this once per card to choose
 * between the picture branch and the emoji-on-a-tint branch, and nothing
 * re-renders that choice when the scenes land - so a card that answered "no"
 * at first paint would keep the emoji for the whole session. Answering "yes,
 * shortly" keeps the branch fixed and lets `GameArt` swap only its own
 * contents, which is also one fewer layout change on the first screen.

/**
 * A game's key art, with the emoji as the fallback.
 *
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is the right tool and not a shortcut: the art is
 * authored in this repo as an SVG string so that `src/build` can emit the very
 * same markup into a page that has no React at all. Nothing here comes from a
 * user, a network response, or a game.
 *
 * The fallback is not decoration either. A game added tomorrow has no scene
 * yet, and it must still render - `gameArt()` returning "" would otherwise
 * leave a silent empty box, which is the failure this whole component exists
 * to end.
 *
 * It lives in `@ui` rather than beside the home grid because the boards screen
 * shows the same games and must show them the same way; a second copy would be
 * a second answer to "what does this game look like".
 *
 * The file is `gameArtView.tsx` and not `GameArt.tsx` on purpose: this repo
 * sits on `/mnt/c`, which is case-INSENSITIVE, so `@ui/GameArt` and
 * `@ui/gameArt` are the same path there and a different path in CI. The import
 * silently resolved to the SVG module instead. Never name a file here as a
 * case-variant of a neighbour.
