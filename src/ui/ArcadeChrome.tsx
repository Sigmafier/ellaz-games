/**
 * The arcade HUD: the chrome a SHOWCASE game wears instead of the shared bar.
 *
 * "A - bars and pips", picked by the operator on 2026-09-13 off a drawn mock
 * rendered at their own 1536x695: hearts as a bar, a big score, the weapon
 * rotation as pips you can count without looking away, and the golem's health
 * across the bottom. The alternatives it beat were minimal corner numbers and a
 * framed cabinet.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A SECOND `GameChrome`. The shared bar is three cards above a
 * board: correct for 42 games, and for a game you stare at for three minutes it
 * puts every number you need OUTSIDE the thing you are looking at. This draws
 * the same numbers ON the arena, which is the whole of the operator's second
 * ask - "more like a real game and not the default boring controls".
 *
 * IT IS SELECTED BY BAND, NEVER BY ID. A game wears this because its `meta.tier`
 * is `"showcase"`; there is no `id === "survivors"` anywhere in this file or at
 * its call site, and `arcade-chrome-is-tier-not-id.test.ts` is the gate that
 * keeps it that way. The moment a HUD keys on an id it stops being a standard
 * and becomes one game's decoration.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 * - It does not import a game. The slots arrive as DATA (`hud.slots`), so this
 *   file knows nothing about weapons, golems or upgrades - `src/ui` may not
 *   import from `src/games`, and a HUD that needed to would be a HUD for one
 *   game wearing a general name.
 * - It does not draw the difficulty itself. `DifficultySelector` is the house
 *   component for a level row and hand-rolling another one is what the
 *   convention forbids.
 * - It does not own restart or pause. Those are registered into the page's
 *   utility row exactly as `GameChrome` registers them, by the same two
 *   functions, so a showcase game keeps the controls every other game has and
 *   the platform chrome stays in one place.

 * off four rendered over the live game. It is not decoration. The three rows it

 * a control without landing on a number; that collision is what sank the
 * alternative in its first render. And every one of those numbers is
 * meaningless before a run starts: zero score, full hearts, a clock at its
 * start. Hiding them is what makes this read as a title screen rather than as a
 * pause cover.

          `entrance === undefined`, NOT `!entrance`, and the difference is a bug
          I shipped for twenty minutes. `!entrance` is true while a run is LIVE
          (the game passes null then), so the row came back under the arena the
          moment you pressed Play - the exact row this change removed, at the
          exact moment the board is sized as though nothing were there. The
          board gate could not see it because it never presses Play; the probe
          caught it by counting the panel's children mid-run.

          So the two states mean different things and are read differently:
            undefined -> this game has no entrance at all; draw the row here.
            null      -> this game HAS one and is mid-run; draw nothing. */}

          restart on the one screen a player wants it, so this is not a control
          lost - except in one case, stated rather than hidden: a SHOWCASE game
          shipped as a standalone bundle would have no mid-run restart, because
          a standalone has no utility row either. No showcase game ships
          standalone today (survivors is not in the roster), so nothing is
