/**
 * The pause control in `GameChrome`, pinned as SOURCE rather than as a render.
 *
 * Two of the three properties below are invisible to a rendered-DOM check, and
 * that is why they are here:
 *
 *  - the level toggle's shrink floor. Flex items shrink before they overflow,
 *    so a fourth nav button squeezing the toggle produces a row whose scroll
 *    width equals its client width, no element wider than its frame, and the
 *    only symptom a missing glyph INSIDE the card. Measured before this floor
 *    existed: `Expert` rendered as `Exper` in the boards' copy of the same
 *    defect. See a-row-that-grows-with-the-catalog-must-wrap.md.
 *  - the cover being opaque rather than a scrim. A see-through pause renders
 *    perfectly and is simply the cheapest strategy in a falling-block game.
 *
 * vitest runs `environment: "node"` here and collects only `*.test.ts`, so a
 * component cannot be mounted in this suite at all - which is the same reason
 * `difficulty-row-must-wrap.test.ts` next door reads its file.
