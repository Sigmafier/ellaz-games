/**
 * The entrance screen's invariants - the ones a refactor breaks silently.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SAY, up front rather than discovered later. These
 * are SOURCE assertions. They cannot tell you the entrance RENDERS; only a
 * browser can, and `scripts/repro/repro-board-fills-the-window.mjs` plus the
 * shots published for the operator are what carry that claim. What they CAN do
 * is stop four specific regressions that produce a page which still looks
 * plausible:
 *
 *   1. the HUD drawn UNDER the cover - four numbers bleeding through a title
 *      screen, which is what the alternative's first render looked like;
 *   2. the difficulty drawn TWICE - once on the cover and once under the arena,
 *      which puts the row back and silently re-steals the board's height;
 *   3. a restart button beside a "Play again" that already restarts;
 *   4. the cover refusing pointers the way the HUD does, which would make the
 *      one surface here a player must press unpressable.
 *
 * EVERY CHECK CARRIES ITS OWN MUTATION. A source scan that has never been
 * watched failing is indistinguishable from one whose regex stopped matching,
 * and this repo has a file full of instances. So each assertion is run twice:
 * once against the real source, and once against a copy with the property
 * deliberately broken, which must NOT pass.
