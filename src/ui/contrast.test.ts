 * LABEL PAIRINGS - the pairs a component actually declares, at the 4.5 floor.

 * This block exists because the assertion above it was green over a real
 * defect for months, and it was green for two separate reasons worth naming.
 *
 * 1. IT USED THE WRONG FLOOR. "on-brand label on the brand fill" asserts >= 3.
 *    3:1 is the floor for a UI COMPONENT or a graphic - the chip's fill
 *    against the card behind it. The label ON that fill is text, and text is
 *    4.5. --on-brand on market's --brand measures 3.14, so the one assertion
 *    covering the brand button passed a pairing that fails for its own label.
 *
 * 2. IT ASSERTED A PAIR NOTHING RENDERED. The pair in the test is
 *    (--on-brand, --brand). The pair `Button`, `ReportSheet` and `Lab` all
 *    shipped is (--text, --brand-fill), which the test never names. A
 *    contrast suite built from a hand-kept list of token pairs measures the
 *    list, not the app - the same shape as
 *    `.claude/rules/a-path-filter-is-a-hand-kept-mirror-of-an-import-graph.md`.
 *
 * Measured on RENDERED PIXELS 2026-09-02, not on the CSS, because a gradient
 * only has a ratio once something paints it:
