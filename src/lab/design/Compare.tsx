 * only in the tokens the bench writes - so what is measured below is the
 * difference the variant makes and nothing else. Two different builds, or a
 * screenshot against a live site, would each fold in every unrelated change
 * that landed in between, which is how a comparison starts agreeing with
 * whatever you already believed.
 *
 * The diff is READ from the two documents with `getBoundingClientRect`. It is
 * never typed, because a typed diff is a claim about a pair rather than the
 * pair - the exact thing the operator asked to stop reading.

 * end. `games.ts` is already in the shell, so this costs the lab nothing.
