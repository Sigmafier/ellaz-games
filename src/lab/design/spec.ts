/**
 * The Design Bench - a chrome layout as DATA.
 *
 * The problem this exists for: a header gets approved as a picture, and what
 * ships is a different half-done version, because nothing anywhere holds the
 * approved numbers in a form the code can be compared against. A `ChromeSpec`
 * IS that form. Every decision about how the game chrome is laid out becomes a
 * named variant here, `variant-is-shipped.test.ts` pins the shipped one against
 * the real source files, and the bench renders any of them over a real game.
 *
 * MEASURED, not typed. `shipped` was read off `src/build/layout.ts` and
 * `src/ui/GameChrome.tsx`; `g1` was read off `dist-g1/`, the approved-G1 build
 * of 2026-08-20 20:32, with `scripts/` doing the extraction rather than a
 * person copying digits. That is the whole point - a spec somebody retyped is
 * the same class of artifact as the prose it replaced.
 *
 * This module is PURE apart from `applySpec`, which takes the element to write
 * to. It ships inside the `lab-*` chunk and reaches no child's device.

 * The header the operator approved, recovered from `dist-g1/`.

 * was approved which silently becomes a copy of whatever ships next - the
 * exact drift this whole bench exists to stop, one file inside the bench. It
 * showed itself the first time the shipped row changed: raising `--uh` for
 * the row's clearance would have rewritten history to say G1 asked for it.
 *
 * It differed from `SHIPPED` in exactly one place when recovered - the
 * breadcrumb, which was plain text then and became a pill afterwards. That
 * last difference CLOSED on 2026-08-23: the operator was shown both arms
 * measured and chose plain, so the shipped rule went back to what this record
 * always said. `SHIPPED` and `G1` are now equal in every field.
 *
 * AMENDED 2026-08-23, by the operator, deliberately and dated - which is the
 * opposite of the drift above rather than an exception to it. `uh` was
 * recovered as 52/46, and 46 against a 44px button is ONE PIXEL of clearance:
 * not a number anybody picked, just what you get when a row is sized to its
 * tallest child. It was raised to 60/56 on 2026-08-22 and the operator kept
 * that when the bench could finally show them the difference ("Keep 56, update
 * G1"). So the record now says 60/56 too, and the bench stops reporting a
 * difference that was really "this record predates a fix".
 *
 * The rule the spread violated and this does not: a record may be CHANGED, by
 * the person whose record it is, with the date and the reason written down. It
 * may not change by itself because something else moved.

/**
 * Write a spec onto an element as custom properties plus `data-design-*`
 * attributes.
 *
 * Nothing here re-renders a component or rewrites markup: the real CSS and the
 * real inline styles read these tokens, so what the bench shows IS the shipped
 * rendering path with different numbers in it. A bench that drew its own
 * approximation would be the static mock we are replacing.
 *
 * The narrow values are not written - a media query decides which arm applies,
 * and a custom property set on the root would beat it. The bench dials the arm
 * the current viewport is in; `hhNarrow`/`uhNarrow` exist so the pin can see
 * them and so a variant carries both.
 *
 * TWO SURFACES, and they are not interchangeable - this is the whole bug of
 * 2026-08-23, found by ground-truth-probing a KPI rather than by reading code:
 *
 *   TOKENS     -> the BODY. `layout.ts` declares them in `body.screen{...}`,
 *                 and a declaration ON an element beats one inherited from its
 *                 parent - so a token written on `<html>` is inherited straight
 *                 past by the very rule that defines it. Measured on the live
 *                 G1 arm: `<html>` carried `--uh: 46px`, the computed value on
 *                 the body was 56px, and the row drew 56. Every numeric knob in
 *                 the drawer was inert, and `#/lab/design` therefore compared
 *                 two arms that could only ever differ in the breadcrumb.
 *
 *   ATTRIBUTES -> the ROOT. The candidate CSS selects `:root[data-design-*]`,
 *                 which is why the breadcrumb was the one thing that DID work,
 *                 and why "just write everything to the body" would have traded
 *                 one silent half for the other.
 *
 * So `applySpec` resolves both from the element it is handed rather than
 * trusting the caller to pass the right one. `Buttons.tsx` has carried a
 * comment about this exact trap since the bench existed; the lesson never
 * travelled to `Drawer.tsx`, and nothing could see that because a token that
 * does nothing renders identically to a token whose value already matches.
