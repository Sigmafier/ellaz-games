/**
 * A real page, previewed at its real width, on a screen narrower than it.
 *
 * This owns the whole PREVIEW COLUMN - its controls, the frame, the note under
 * it - because two of the three things below only work if one element owns all
 * three.
 *
 * SCALE, NEVER NARROW. The frame stays `w` CSS pixels wide whatever the screen
 * is, so the document inside still lays out as a `w`-wide viewport - media
 * queries and `position:fixed` both read it - and every number measured off it
 * is the number a real phone produces. The transform is paint, not layout: a
 * `getBoundingClientRect` inside the frame is in the FRAME's coordinate space
 * and a transform out here cannot reach it. Narrowing the frame instead would
 * answer a question nobody asked, which is what a 366px preview of a 390px
 * screen is.
 *
 * THE SHIELD is the one that made the bench unusable. An iframe is a separate
 * document, so a swipe that lands on it scrolls THAT page - and a game page is
 * `body{overflow:hidden}`, so it scrolls nothing and the gesture is simply
 * eaten. Measured on ellaz.fun at 390x844: the preview spanned y=182..742, two
 * thirds of the screen, and a wheel over it moved the lab by 0px while the
 * same wheel 40px lower moved it by 1146. That is the whole of "the lab does
 * not do anything" - the knobs were below the fold behind a dead zone.
 *
 * So a transparent sheet sits over the frame and the gesture reaches the page
 * again. Poking the game is then a deliberate act, which is the right default
 * for a surface whose job is to be LOOKED at.
 *
 * THE PIN keeps the preview on screen while the knobs are dialled underneath
 * it, because on a phone the columns stack and a knob you cannot see the
 * effect of is barely better than one that does nothing.
