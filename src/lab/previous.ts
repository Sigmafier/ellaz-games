// What each sound used to be, held here so every strip keeps a real control arm.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: a candidate that IMPORTS the shipped constant
// stops being a control the instant the shipped constant changes. On 2026-08-13
// nine voices were replaced at once, and every "was" arm in `voices.ts` pointed
// at exactly the constant that moved - so without this file the gallery would
// have shipped nine strips each containing the new voice twice, one copy
// labelled with the old name, and no test able to tell the difference because
// both would still be perfectly valid specs.
//
// That is the precise ambiguity the deleted Juice Lab recorded as "the control
// won", which took a week to become unreadable. A control arm is only evidence
// if it is pinned to a literal.
//
// These are TRANSCRIPTIONS, byte-for-byte, of what `@sdk/voice` exported before
// that date. The builders come from `@sdk/voice` on purpose - `struck` and
// `run` are the shared physics, not the shipped voices, so importing them
// cannot drift and re-implementing them here would be a second copy of the
// damping law. Nothing below may import TAP / POP / SUCCESS / any of the nine.
//
// This whole file lives in the lab's lazy chunk. A child's first visit pays
// nothing for the history.
