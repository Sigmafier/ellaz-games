/**
 * The three screens that hold a playable surface - a game, the room, the
 * boards - wear ONE header, carrying PLATFORM controls only, with the game's
 * own controls below it.
 *
 * Nothing mechanical else keeps any of that true. The header is a string built
 * at build time and the game panel is React, so a control drifting from one to
 * the other type-checks, renders and passes every other test in this repo. And
 * the three screens are emitted by three different functions, so a control
 * added to one of them is invisible from the other two.
 *
 * The specific things being prevented, both of which shipped:
 *
 * - FOUR ways home in one viewport on a game page (a wordmark, a back arrow,
 *   the breadcrumb's Home link and a house button in the row below), and a
 *   header with no width for the game's own name because it was carrying game
 *   controls.
 * - THREE different bars across one product - tinted on a game, transparent
 *   and floating over the room, a white document row on the boards - so "how
 *   do I get home", "where are my coins" and "how do I mute" each had a
 *   different answer per screen, and the room's answers were drawn inside the
 *   scene rather than in any header at all.
 *

/**
 * SHARE - a GAME control, so it is on the game page and nowhere else.
 *
 * The rule's own test settles which family it is in: "would this control still
 * mean anything on the World screen or the Boards?" Sharing THIS game does not,
 * so it is emitted by `gamePage` rather than by `screenChrome`, and it belongs
 * on the utility row with pause and restart rather than in the header with
 * mute and the wallet.
 *
 * That is worth pinning rather than trusting, because the header is a string
 * built by one function and the row by another, and a button moved from one to
 * the other type-checks, renders, and passes every other assertion in this file.
 * Operator ruling 2026-08-25: "we should add per game share options instead."
