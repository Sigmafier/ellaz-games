/**
 * Every character a share card draws must have a glyph in a bundled font.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST AND NOT THE BYTE CHECK. `checkOgCard()` in `assert-pages.mjs`
 * asserts only `4096 < bytes < ceiling`. A card is ~21 KB of game art, so one
 * whose entire title bar is empty rectangles clears that floor by a factor of
 * five. Satori does not throw on a missing glyph - it draws a box - so the
 * artifact is a valid PNG of a title nobody can read, and every existing gate
 * is green. Measured before the fonts landed: Arabic rendered at 128 bytes of
 * path per character against 457-703 for Latin. Those were the boxes.
