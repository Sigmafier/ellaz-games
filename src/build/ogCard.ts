/* Open Graph share cards - the picture a link grows when someone sends it.
   ===========================================================================

   WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 2026-08-08 no page carried an `og:image`, so every
   link shared to WhatsApp - which is how an Israeli parent actually passes a
   game to another parent - previewed as a bare line of text. That is a
   distribution problem rather than a ranking one, and distribution is worth
   more to this site than any amount of markup.

   WHY IT IS BUILT FROM `gameArt` AND NOT A SCREENSHOT. The same reason the
   home grid is: the art is authored in this repo as flat SVG, it already says
   what each game looks like, and there is exactly one answer to that question.
   A screenshot pipeline would be a second answer, and it would need a browser.

   THE TRAP THIS FILE IS SHAPED AROUND: NEITHER RENDERER DOES BIDI. A
   rasteriser is not a browser. `resvg` lays `<text>` out in LOGICAL order, so
   "נחש" rasterises as "שחנ" - a perfectly clean PNG of nonsense - and
   `direction="rtl"` does not fix it. `satori` gets it wrong the same way, and
   its `direction: "rtl"` style does not fix it either. Both were measured, not
   assumed: rendering single glyphs, matching their outlines inside the merged
   path of the full word, and sorting by x. An eyeball check passed this bug,
   which is exactly why the check is mechanical now.

   So the visual order is computed HERE, by `bidi-js` (UAX#9), and the renderer
   only ever receives a string already in the order it should paint. Naive
   reversal is NOT a substitute and two shipping titles prove it: "2048" must
   stay "2048" rather than "8402", and "מה בא אחר כך?" must put its question
   mark on the LEFT. `ogCard.test.ts` pins both.

   Kept DOM-free and satori-free on purpose. This module returns plain data;
   `ogImages.ts` owns the async, native, font-loading half. That split is what
   lets the layout be unit-tested without a rasteriser. */
