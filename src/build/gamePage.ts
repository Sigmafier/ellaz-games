 * headings, the platform facts. A writer never types "free" or "works offline"
 * into a content file, so no page can claim something the platform does not do.
 *
 * There is no React in this file. The page carries the app's own head tags, so
 * the same bundle boots here as at `/`, and it mounts into exactly two elements:
 * `#game-frame` and `#wallet-slot`. Everything else on the page - every word of
 * it - is emitted once and never reconciled, which is what makes hydration
 * mismatch structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * The poster is a SIBLING of the frame, not a child. A node React does not know
 * about, sitting inside a tree it reconciles, is the nested-root teardown bug in
 * a different costume (see `.claude/rules/react-nested-root-teardown.md`).

/**
 * Nine other games worth a click: up to six shelf-mates, then whatever else it

 *
 * SORTING BY RANK, the old algorithm, put the same head-of-category games on
 * every page in that category - `slice(0, 6)` after a stable sort always
 * returns the SAME six for every member of a shelf, so a shelf of 11 sends all
 * eleven pages to the same six neighbours and the other five of that shelf get
 * zero related-game links sitewide. Measured on the 2026-09 roster: 14 of 45
 * games had 0-1 inbound related links, because nothing in a rank-and-slice
 * scheme ever points BACK.
 *
 * ROTATION fixes it by construction. A shelf of S games, each pointing at the
 * `min(6, S-1)` games that follow it in roster order (wrapping), is a circulant
 * graph: reading the same rotation backwards is exactly who points AT a given
 * game, so out-degree and in-degree are equal within the shelf. A shelf too
 * small for six (`create` has one member, `speed` has four) still has every
 * member point at every other member, which is the same equality at S-1.
 *
 * The remaining slots - three for a full shelf, more for a small one - are
 * filled by walking the WHOLE roster from a fixed offset roughly half of it
 * around, skipping this game's own shelf and anything already picked. That
 * offset is what makes the cross-shelf edges reciprocal too: a game's own
 * cross-shelf picks land on a different stretch of the roster than the games
 * that, walking from THEIR position, land on it. The "gives every game at
 * least 3 inbound related-game links" test in `build.test.ts` is the actual
 * guarantee - it walks the live roster and asserts every game clears the
 * floor - because the algorithm's job is to make that test easy to keep
 * passing as the roster grows, not to prove it in the abstract.
 *
 * BETA games (`meta.beta`) get no special case, on purpose: CLAUDE.md's own
 * rule is that a beta game "plays and ranks like a finished one," and this

 * with a second copy of the app before anyone scrolled to it. Measured on
 * 2026-09-05 against the built `/games/match3/`, that reasoning was wrong in
 * every part:
 *
 *   two 64-cell boards live in one document, 7,624 px tall
 *   the frame had booted on load - lazy loads generously, and a page this
 *     tall is inside the browser's own margin
 *   the frame is SAME-ORIGIN, so it shares `ellaz:<gameId>:session` with the
 *     game the player is playing above it: reloaded, it came back at
 *     `Score 30 / Moves 24`, which was their position, not a demo
 *
 * A player reported it as "the bottom embed place renders the game twice",
 * which is exactly what it was. So the markup now carries the game's own key
 * art and a button, and the iframe is built by `wireEmbedPreview` in
 * `PageApp.tsx` only once somebody asks for it. Without script there is a
 * picture and the code, which is the honest degraded state.
 *
 * The `<pre>` holds the snippet as TEXT: the tagged template escapes it, the
 * browser decodes it, and `textContent` hands the runtime the raw bytes back.
 * That is the copy path (`wireEmbedCopy` in `PageApp.tsx`) - `textContent`,
 * never `innerHTML`, which would copy the escaped display and hand a stranger
 * `&lt;iframe`. `embed.test.ts` decodes the emitted `<pre>` and requires it to
 * equal `embedSnippet` byte for byte.
 *
 * The button is emitted `hidden` like every other control the runtime owns:
 * without a script it does nothing, and a button that does nothing is worse
 * than none. The `<pre>` stays selectable by hand either way.
 *
 * The preview's src carries the BASE, the snippet's does not: the preview is
 * our own page loading our own document on whichever host we are on; the
