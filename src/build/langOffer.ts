/**
 * The language OFFER - one line at the very top of an emitted document, telling
 * a reader that this page exists in the language their browser asked for.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS, measured. Search Console, 2026-08-04 to 08-18: 76% of the
 * queries reaching this site are Hebrew and 65% of the impressions are Israel,
 * and 11% of those impressions land on a `/he/` URL. Six Hebrew minesweeper
 * queries earn 19 impressions while `/he/games/minesweeper/` earns zero of
 * them - Google serves the ENGLISH page, which has 33. The Hebrew page exists,
 * is titled with the exact words being typed, and ranks around 6 wherever
 * Google does serve a Hebrew page against a mean of 27 for the English twins.
 * The reader simply never learns it is there.
 *
 * It is NOT a redirect, and that is a hard rule rather than a preference: a
 * crawler follows a redirect too, so redirecting on an inferred language hides
 * every other version of the page and drops them out of the index. Google says
 * so in writing. Clause SEO3.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT IS EMITTED RATHER THAN RENDERED
 *
 * The obvious build is a React component. It would have cost the first visit
 * real bytes on a ceiling with 66 to spare, it would have appeared only after
 * the bundle arrived - which is the wrong moment for somebody who just landed
 * from a search result - and it would have had to be written once for the
 * content pages and again for the app.
 *
 * Emitted, it costs a first visit EXACTLY NOTHING (`src/build/**` ships to
 * nobody), it is on screen in the first paint, and it covers every language
 * automatically: the rows are derived from the page's own hreflang cluster, so
 * promoting a fifth locale gives every page a fifth row with no edit here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ONE PLACE IT IS NOT
 *
 * The four home shells (`/`, `/he/`, `/es/`, `/fr/`). They render no
 * `DOCUMENT_CSS` and no emitted chrome - the app draws all of it - so the bar
 * would have to live in the bundle, which is the cost this design exists to
 * avoid. They are 4 of 164 documents and 11% of the impressions; the 160 that
 * carry it are where the arrivals actually land. Stated rather than left to be
 * discovered.

 * parsing - so the attribute is set before anything below is parsed and before
 * the first paint, and the row appears with the page rather than jumping into
 * it. A deferred script here is a 46px layout shift on every page.
 *
 * It reads `navigator.languages` in order and stops at the first entry that is
 * either this page's language (nothing to offer, leave) or a language this page
 * has a row for (offer it). Entries for languages the site does not publish are
 * skipped, so a reader whose list is `de, en` on a Hebrew page is offered
 * English rather than nothing.
 *
 * Everything is inside one try/catch. `localStorage` throws outright in some
 * private-browsing modes, and a thrown error here would be a script tag failing
 * on every document on the site.
