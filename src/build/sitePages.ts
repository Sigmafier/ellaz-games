 * page - the header of all 25 English game pages, the room, the boards, and
 * `exitTo`'s floor in `PageApp` - lands on `/en/`, and what arrived was a
 * static article. No grid, no wallet, no world, no daily, nothing to tap but a
 * list of links. A player calls that broken and they are right: it is the home
 * screen's URL serving something that is not the home screen.
 *
 * The Hebrew home has been both a document AND the app since the AI-crawler fix
 * (`a-spa-shell-is-invisible-to-ai-crawlers.md`); there was never a reason for
 * the other languages to be only the first half. So this emits the same shape
 * `transformIndexHtml` gives `/`, in this page's language.
 *
 * NOT A LOSS OF PROSE. `homeShellBody` carries the whole home page - heading,
 * lede, facts, every game link, the body paragraphs, the room and the boards -
 * so a crawler reads exactly what it read before. What goes is the document
 * chrome around it, which is what the app draws for itself.

/**
 * A home page as a DOCUMENT, for the pages that are also the application.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `/` is `index.html`, and until 2026-08-11 it shipped a 29-byte body:
 * `<div id="root"></div>`. Googlebot renders JavaScript so it eventually saw the
 * React grid - but no AI crawler does. GPTBot, ClaudeBot and PerplexityBot fetch
 * raw HTML, take what is there, and move on; Anthropic's own docs say the fetch
 * tool does not support JavaScript-rendered sites. So the canonical entry of a
 * Hebrew-first site, and the `x-default` target, was a blank page to every
 * answer engine, while `/en/` - a real emitted document - was not.
 *
 * It is the same shape as the other outages written up in this repo: correct
 * everywhere you look, wrong for a population you are not in.
 *
 * WHY IT IS PLAIN MARKUP
 * `DOCUMENT_CSS` is ~300 lines, and `/` is the one page that IS the first
 * visit, so it does not carry it and must not start. This emits the same
 * CONTENT as plain semantic markup instead: same copy, same games, same links,
 * same order, styled by the handful of `#home-doc` rules in `global.css`.
 *
 * WHY IT TAKES A LOCALE
 * Because all three home pages are the app, and all three therefore need this
 * body. It was hardcoded to Hebrew while `/en/` and `/es/` were documents; the
 * moment they became shells too, one hardcoded language here would have
 * emitted the Hebrew home under `lang="en"` - a page that renders, passes the
 * word floor, and is in the wrong language. The script gate in
 * `assert-pages.mjs` is the control that would catch it.
 *
 * NOT CLOAKING. Everything here is what the app renders once it boots, in the
 * same language and the same order. It is progressive enhancement, which is
 * what Google's JavaScript SEO guidance asks for - and it is why the runtime
 * REMOVES this block rather than hiding it behind CSS.

 * How many of the home document's tiles carry their game's emoji and colour.

 *
 * WHY IT IS BOUNDED AT ALL, and this is not a taste decision: decoration costs
 * ~17 B gz PER GAME on the first visit - the emoji glyph barely compresses and
 * the colour is close to unique - so decorating all 42 took the catalogue slope
 * from 32.5 to **47.0 B gz per game against a 45 B budget**, and `assert:slope`
 * refused the build. That gate is not a threshold to argue with: the first visit
 * must be O(1) in the size of the roster, and a per-game cost that grows forever
 * is exactly what it exists to catch. Measured 2026-09-08, two arms from one
 * copy, 42 games against 34.
 *
 * WHY 12, AND WHY IT IS NO LONGER `SHELL_META_COUNT`. The bound used to be 15,
 * pinned EQUAL to the number of cards the app paints on its own first frame
 * (`SHELL_META_COUNT`, `src/portal/shellRoster.ts`). That equality was never the
 * property anyone wanted - it was a convenient number that happened to cover the
 * fold. The property is: decorate every tile a visitor can SEE in that half
 * second, and not one more.
 *
 * So the fold was measured rather than estimated. The emitted document, loaded
 * with JAVASCRIPT OFF so it is the poster and not the app that replaces it:
 *
 *     390x844   9 fully visible, 12 with any pixel on screen
 *     412x915   9 fully visible, 12 with any pixel on screen
 *
 * 12, therefore - the partly-visible count, because a tile half on screen that
 * changes is still a change on screen. The prose this replaces said "around tile
 * 9 to 12" and a reading of 9 was nearly shipped on it; three tiles would have
 * gone plain-then-coloured on every phone, which is the exact flash this poster
 * exists to remove. Measured 2026-09-20, Chromium, `dist/index.html` over
 * file://, four viewports.
 *
 * THE TWO BOUNDS ARE NOW SEPARATE AND BOTH ARE PINNED in
 * `home-tiles-match-the-grid.test.ts`, because they answer different questions:
 *
 *   >= 12  every tile visible on a phone is decorated, or the flash is back.
 *   <= SHELL_META_COUNT  never decorate a tile the app is NOT about to paint as
 *          a real card - that one swaps a coloured tile for a reserved box,
 *          which is content DISAPPEARING and is worse than the flash.
 *
 * The test cannot import `SHELL_META_COUNT`: the alias `@sdk/index` that
 * `shellRoster.ts` imports is unavailable to `src/build/**`, which Node loads
 * from `vite.config.ts` at config time where no Vite alias exists yet. It reads
 * both numbers out of the two files instead.
 *
 * WHAT IT BUYS: 35 B gz off the first visit, two arms from one tree, 2026-09-20.
 * Small, and the first visit had 12 B of headroom when it was measured.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS, AND IT IS NOT NOTHING ON A DESKTOP. Both arms rendered with JS
 * off and every tile with a pixel on screen counted, 2026-09-20 - `pop` is a
 * tile the poster draws plain that the app then paints coloured:
 *
 *      390x844    12 on screen    0 pop -> 0 pop     no change
 *      412x915    12 on screen    0 pop -> 0 pop     no change
 *     1536x639    18 on screen    3 pop -> 6 pop     +3
 *    1920x1080    42 on screen   27 pop -> 30 pop    +3
 *
 * The phone is byte-identical - a 390x844 screenshot of each arm has the SAME
 * md5 - and a desktop gets three more tiles that flash. That trade was made
 * knowingly: the bound has NEVER been chosen for a desktop. At 1920 the app
 * puts 42 tiles on screen and the old bound of 15 already left 27 flashing, so
 * a PC has never had the property this constant exists to provide. Fixing that
 * is not a bigger number - 42 tiles of decoration is what `assert:slope`
 * refused in the first place - it is a different mechanism, and nobody has
 * measured whether a desktop visitor sees the poster long enough to care.
 *
 * The commit that introduced this bound said 24 rather than 30 and mixed two
 * visibility measures (fully visible against any-pixel). The table above is
 * the corrected one; it could not be fixed in that message because a peer had
 * already committed on top of it.

 * reaches. Google could find them through the sitemap; a person could not.
 *
 * It is the same defect the /boards/ link above is annotated for, and the same
 * fix: this block is the only inbound link a crawler or a no-JavaScript visitor
 * can follow, because the runtime removes `#home-doc` once React mounts. The
 * app draws its own row (`Home.tsx`), so REMOVING EITHER HALF RE-ORPHANS THE

 *
 * `PRINTABLE_KINDS` AND NOT `PRINT_KINDS`. The derived list is the one that
 * gets documents written for it: a pack whose game has left the roster is not
 * emitted, and linking it would be a 404 in our own markup. `assert-slope.mjs`
 * builds an arm with the last eight games cut and the wordsearch pack has
 * already killed that arm once, so this is a live population, not a formality.
 *

 * earned landed on `/games/memory/`, a page about one game rather than a page
 * about a group. `seo-doctrine` SEO16 is the clause it ratified.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A PURE DOCUMENT AND BOOTS NOTHING
 * The home page, the room and the boards are all SCREENS in the app, and an
 * emitted document served at a screen's own URL is the defect written up in
 * `homePage` above - a person calls it broken and they are right. A category
 * page is not a screen: there is no `#/games/kids` in this app, nothing is
 * missing from it, and every link on it goes somewhere that does boot. So it
 * carries no `headAssets`, fetches no chunk, and costs a first visit nothing.
 *
 * The measurement tag is the one exception, and it is deliberate: these are
 * the pages the whole exercise exists to measure, so a document that is
 * indexable carries it while the 404 still does not. `assert-pages.mjs` allows
 * exactly that one script on a non-booting page and nothing else.
 *
 * THE LIST COMES FIRST, ON PURPOSE. Somebody arriving from a search for
 * "puzzle games for kids" wants the games, not our prose about them. The
