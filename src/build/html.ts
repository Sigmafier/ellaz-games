/**
 * The escaping tagged template every emitted page is built from.
 *
 * `src/build/**` is BUILD-TIME ONLY. It runs in Node, inside a Vite plugin. It
 * has no DOM, no React, and no filesystem - it turns data into strings and
 * nothing else. Nothing in the app may import it (`no-app-imports.test.ts`
 * guards the direction).
 *
 * WHY A TAGGED TEMPLATE RATHER THAN PLAIN CONCATENATION
 * Every value interpolated into a page is prose written by a human, and prose
 * contains `&`, `<`, `"` and apostrophes. Escaping at the concatenation site
 * means remembering to escape at 400 concatenation sites. Escaping in the
 * template means the DEFAULT is safe and the exception has to be spelled out
 * with `raw()`, which greps.
