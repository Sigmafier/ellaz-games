/* The rasterising half of the share cards. Build-time only, never the app.
   ===========================================================================

   `ogCard.ts` decides what a card looks like and returns plain data. This file
   owns everything that makes that hard to test: a native rasteriser, two font
   binaries, and async.

   THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. satori shapes text and emits PATHS; resvg then
   rasterises geometry it does not have to understand. Handing resvg `<text>`
   instead would render Hebrew reversed - see the header of `ogCard.ts`. The
   assertion below fails the build if satori ever stops embedding fonts, which
   is the one upstream change that would reintroduce it silently. */

/**
 * WHY THREE FAMILIES, AND WHY THESE THREE.
 *
 * Heebo covers Latin and Hebrew and nothing else. Measured on the bundled
 * files: **zero** Arabic codepoints and **zero** Cyrillic. Satori does not
 * throw on a missing glyph - it emits a rectangle - so an Arabic or Russian
 * card rasterises as a clean PNG full of tofu boxes. Measured through the real
 * rasteriser, path geometry per character: Latin 457-703, Hebrew 289, and
 * **Russian 150, Arabic 128**. Those two are the boxes.
 *
 * And `checkOgCard()` in `assert-pages.mjs` asserts only that the file is
 * between 4 KB and the WhatsApp ceiling. A real card is ~21 KB dominated by the
 * game art, so a card whose entire title bar is empty rectangles passes with
 * room to spare. 32 broken cards per language, every gate green. The glyph
 * gate beside that byte check is what closes it.
 *
 * REGISTERED UNDER THEIR OWN FAMILY NAMES, which is not cosmetic. Measured:
 * adding a font under the SAME family name changes nothing at all - satori
 * takes the first match for a family+weight and never falls back within it, so
 * Arabic stayed at 128/char. Under its own name it falls back per glyph and
 * Cyrillic went 150 -> 645/char.
 *
 * CAIRO RATHER THAN NOTO SANS ARABIC, and this one cost the most to find.
 * Satori's opentype fork **throws** on Noto Sans Arabic, Noto Kufi Arabic and
 * Amiri: `lookupType: 5 - substFormat: 3 is not yet supported`. The obvious
 * choice is the one that breaks the build. Cairo, Tajawal and Almarai all parse;
 * Cairo is the pick because it is a rounded, friendly face that sits beside
 * Fredoka and Heebo without looking like a different product.
 *
 * ARABIC JOINING WORKS - do not add a shaper. It is easy to assume this fork
 * does bidi but not shaping, and that is wrong. Tested by rendering one letter
 * and the same letter doubled: if no shaper ran, the pair's outline would be
 * the isolated outline twice. It is not, while the LATIN control ("n" vs "nn")
 * IS exactly doubled - so the method can report "no shaping" and simply does
 * not here. Contextual forms are being substituted.
 *
 * All three families are SIL Open Font License 1.1; see the `*-LICENSE.txt`
 * files beside them. Bundled rather than fetched so a build never depends on
 * the network, and BUILD-TIME ONLY - `src/build` ships to nobody, so these
 * 68 KB cost a first visit exactly zero.
