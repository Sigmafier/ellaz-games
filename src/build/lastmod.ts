/* `<lastmod>`, derived from git. Build-time only.
   ===========================================================================

   Google uses `<lastmod>` for crawl scheduling ONLY while it stays accurate,
   and an inaccurate one is worse than none: the signal gets discounted and
   does not come back. So the whole design here is about refusing to guess.

   THE OBVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION IS THE WRONG ONE. Stamping build time on all 48
   rows says "every page changed" on every deploy, which is false for 47 of
   them and teaches Google the field is noise. The date has to come from the
   last commit that actually touched each page's own sources.

   AND THE OBVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION FAILS SILENTLY IN CI. `actions/checkout`
   clones at depth 1 by default, so `git log` sees exactly one commit and
   reports the SAME timestamp for every path - which is the build-time bug
   again, wearing a disguise, on the one machine that publishes. Both deploy
   workflows now set `fetch-depth: 0`, and `allSame()` below is the backstop
   for the day someone removes it.

   Every failure here omits the field rather than inventing one. A sitemap
   with no `<lastmod>` is exactly what this site had until now and is
   perfectly valid; a sitemap where all 48 dates agree is a lie. */
