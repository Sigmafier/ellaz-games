/**
 * The embed document: one game, full-viewport, for a stranger's iframe.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. An EMITTED DOCUMENT like a game page - it carries the same
 * `headAssets` and preloads and boots the same bundle - and not a second
 * Vite entry. That is what keeps `assert:first-visit`, `assert:payload` and
 * the precache list untouched by its existence: the shell a child downloads
 * does not know this page exists.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. No header, no breadcrumb, no prose, no
 * footer, no analytics tag, no consent bar, no alternates, no share card of
 * its own. It runs inside a third party's page, so `analytics: false` here
 * and the three skipped calls in `bootContentPage` are the same decision
 * `src/standalone.tsx` spells out in its header: a frame that phones home
 * from somebody else's site is the one thing that makes a game un-listable.
 *
 * ONE PER GAME. Emitted in the canonical locale; `?lang=xx` is read at
 * runtime (`requestedLocale`), so the link at the bottom carries its label
 * and its target for every page locale on `data-` attributes and the runtime
 * picks one - the same arrangement as the poster's three strings, and for
 * the same reason: the runtime may not import `src/content`.
 *
 * `shell: true` because this page IS an application with one screen, exactly
 * like `standalone.html` - it wants `class="app-shell"` (the app tokens, the
 * full-viewport rules) and none of the ~300 lines of DOCUMENT_CSS that style
 * a header, a footer and a card grid it does not have. The few rules it does
 * need are below.
 *
 * The canonical is the GAME PAGE. `renderDocument` derives the canonical and
 * the share card from `path`, so the game page's path is what goes in - the
 * frame is not a destination, the game page is, and a link to the frame
 * previews as the game. The route table says the same thing in
 * `canonicalPath`, and `pages.json` publishes it for the gate.

/**
 * Everything the frame needs that `global.css` does not give `body.app-shell`.
 *
 * `body` is a flex column the height of the frame: the stage takes the room,
 * the one link takes a FIXED 46px row INSIDE that column - never appended
 * below the stage, so the document never grows past the iframe and nothing
 * scrolls. `EMBED_HEIGHT` in `gamePage.ts` is sized against exactly this row.
 *
 * `#game-frame` is CONTENT-SIZED (`flex:0 0 auto`), exactly as on a game page.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE FRAME IS TOO SHORT, measured rather than assumed
 * (2026-09-02, built bundle, fresh load in a real iframe): `.stage .box` CLIPS.
 * At 720x600 maze is 873 px in a 554 px box and 319 px is cut, while
 * `stage.scrollHeight === stage.clientHeight` and the document reports no
 * overflow either - so nothing anywhere says a third of the board is missing.
 * `overflow:auto` on the stage does not save it (an overflowing flex item does
 * not grow an ancestor's scroll area) and neither does `fitStage`, which
 * applied no transform at any size measured here.
 *
 * So the frame's HEIGHT is the whole defence, and that is why `EMBED_HEIGHT`
 * in `gamePage.ts` carries its measurement instead of a round number.
