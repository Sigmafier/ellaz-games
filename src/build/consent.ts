/**
 * The consent bar, emitted rather than bundled.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Google Analytics shipped on 2026-08-20 with `analytics_storage: 'denied'` as
 * a consent DEFAULT that nothing ever updated, and the property was empty for
 * two days while the tag returned 204 on every hit. A denied hit is raw
 * material for behavioural modelling, not a counted pageview, and modelling
 * wants roughly a thousand events a day for a week. Full account:
 * `.claude/rules/a-tag-that-fires-is-not-a-tag-that-counts.md`.
 *
 * The operator ruled on 2026-08-22, having been shown the measurement: grant
 * it, and accept the banner. **The obvious alternative does not exist** -
 * granting writes `_ga` even with `client_storage:'none'` left in place,
 * verified live with a control that wrote and read back its own cookie in the
 * same run. So there is no cookieless-and-counted middle, and a cookie in the
 * EU needs consent.
 *
 * ## The default stays DENIED, and that is the whole design
 *
 * `analyticsTag()` is UNCHANGED: it still declares
 * `analytics_storage:'denied'` on the `consent default` line, before anything
 * is sent. That is correct Consent Mode v2 and it is what makes this bar
 * lawful rather than decorative - the first hit of a first visit goes out
 * denied, and only an explicit Accept flips it with `consent update`. A bar
 * that appeared while the tag was already granted would be theatre.
 *
 * ## Four things here are load-bearing rather than styling
 *
 * 1. **`position: fixed`, out of flow.** A bar in flow pushes the document and
 *    is a layout shift on every page on the site - and this repo spent
 *    2026-08-22 taking `/world/` from CLS 0.2966 to 0.0032. A banner that
 *    reintroduced that would be a straight trade of one metric for another.
 * 2. **Hidden until script says otherwise.** A reader with no JavaScript has no
 *    `gtag` either, so there is nothing to consent to and nothing to dismiss.
 *    Emitting a visible bar they cannot dismiss would be the worst of both.
 * 3. **Accept and Decline are the SAME button.** Same size, same weight, same
 *    shape - a "decline" made quieter than "accept" is the dark pattern the
 *    regulation exists about, and it is one CSS rule away at all times.
 * 4. **Primary host only**, keyed on the same `base === "/"` test the tag uses,
 *    so the noindex mirror cannot show a consent bar for a tag it never loads.

/**
 * `label` is the dialog's ACCESSIBLE NAME, and it is not decoration: an element
 * carrying `role="dialog"` with no name is announced to a screen reader as a
 * dialog about nothing, which is worse than no role at all. Lighthouse failed
 * this on 2026-09-07 in both form factors ("ARIA dialog and alertdialog nodes
 * should have an accessible name") and it was the site's only Agentic Browsing
 * failure too - one missing attribute costing two separate audits.
 *
 * A short noun phrase, NOT the sentence: `aria-labelledby` pointing at the <p>
 * would make the name the whole paragraph, which a screen reader then reads
 * twice - once as the dialog's name and again as its content.
