// One bundle, two shapes of page.

//   /  /he/  /es/        the app shell. React owns #root and the whole viewport.
//                        `/` is Vite's own index.html and is ENGLISH; the other
//                        two are emitted with the same arrangement and a
//                        `data-locale`.
//   /games/<id>/         a document. React owns #game-frame and #wallet-slot,
//   /world/              and nothing else on the page is ever reconciled.
//
// Which one is decided by reading the DOCUMENT, never by parsing the URL: this
// site ships under two bases ("/" and "/ellaz/"), and a runtime that re-derives
// the base gets it wrong on one host and renders prose that never mounts a game.

// The update still applies by itself, with nothing to tap. `applyWhenSafe`
// only decides WHEN - never while a game is on screen. See swUpdate.ts for the
// line in vite-plugin-pwa that used to reload a child out of their game, and
// why suppressing it meant changing the registerType rather than an option.

        // whole point.

      // one that waits.) There is no flash to trade against - the emitted home is
