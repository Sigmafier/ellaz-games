/* --- the runtime page cache, and the one thing that empties it --------------

   `ellaz-pages` below is a NetworkFirst cache of whole DOCUMENTS with a 30-day
   life, and until this existed nothing ever cleared it. Workbox's
   `cleanupOutdatedCaches` cleans the PRECACHE and only the precache, so a
   returning visitor whose network took longer than the 3-second timeout was
   served a page from whatever build happened to be cached - possibly a month
   old - while the server served today's.

   That is this repo's recurring shape, one layer further in: correct for every
   population we can check (curl, a fresh browser, a crawler, the deploy gate)
   and wrong for the one that matters, returning players. It cost a live G1
   deploy that was reported as missing while every check was green.

   The fix runs in the SERVICE WORKER rather than in the page, and that choice
   is the whole point: a client stuck on a stale document is running the stale
   BUNDLE too, so page-side code would be the one copy that never gets to run.
   sw.js is always revalidated (`no-cache` in the .htaccess, and browsers bypass
   the HTTP cache for it anyway), so a new build always reaches `activate` even
   on a client that is otherwise a month behind.

   The cost, stated rather than discovered: a game page visited before the
   deploy is no longer available offline until it is visited online once more.
   The shell at `/` is precached and unaffected. A page from a build that no
   longer exists is worth strictly less than that. */

/* CONTENT-HASHED, and that is a fix rather than tidiness.
   The first version shipped as a bare `sw-purge.js` at the root, relying on a
   FilesMatch in the .htaccess to hold it out of the year-long immutable rule
   that every other .js gets. Measured on the live server: sw.js, 404.html and
   manifest.webmanifest all took the no-cache rule from that same block and
   sw-purge.js did not, so the file a service worker imports through the
   ORDINARY HTTP CACHE (updateViaCache defaults to "imports") was pinned for a
   year - a file that could never be fixed, which is the exact trap this repo
   keeps writing rules about.

   A hash in the name removes the dependency on the header instead of arguing
   with it: immutable becomes CORRECT, because a changed file is a new file.
   Same reason everything under assets/ is hashed, and the same property the
   deploy relies on - the thing deciding what to send cannot be wrong about
   what is already there. It lives in assets/ so the upload's mirror pass,
   which is exact only there, is what carries it. */
