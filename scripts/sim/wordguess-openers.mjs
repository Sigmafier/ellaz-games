/**
 * Derives the opening-word statistics the Word Guess page quotes.
 *
 *   node scripts/sim/wordguess-openers.mjs [--top 5] [--json]
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `src/content/types.ts` requires every number in a game
 * page to name a script that reproduces it, because a statistic you cannot
 * re-derive is a fabrication with a decimal point. This is that script for
 * `src/content/games/wordguess.ts`.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES. For every word in a list, treat it as the opening guess
 * against every possible answer in that same list, mark it by the game's real
 * two-pass rule, and group the answers by the pattern that comes back. A
 * pattern that 12 answers share leaves you 12 candidates; one that a single
 * answer produces leaves you 1. The score is the EXPECTED number of candidates
 * still standing after that first guess:
 *
 *     E = sum over patterns of (n / N) * n
 *
 * which is the size of the group you land in, weighted by the chance of
 * landing in it. Lower is better. It is the honest measure of an opener
 * because it is what the player actually faces on row two.
 *
 * The alternative - counting how many of the answer's letters the opener hits
 * on average - rewards a word that shares letters with everything and tells
 * you nothing about how much it SPLITS the list. Those are different questions
 * and only one of them helps.
 *
 * GROUNDED IN THE REAL LISTS AND THE REAL MARKING RULE. The words are parsed
 * out of `src/games/wordguess/words.ts` and the two-pass mark is reimplemented
 * here from `logic.ts`, so a changed list moves these numbers and a changed
 * list that no longer parses fails loudly rather than quietly describing a
 * game we no longer ship.
 *
 * It is a pure Node script: no imports from the app, no TypeScript, no deps.
