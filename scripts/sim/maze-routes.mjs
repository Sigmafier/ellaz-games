/**
 * Derives the numbers the Way Home page quotes.
 *
 *   node scripts/sim/maze-routes.mjs [--deals 20000] [--json]
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `src/content/types.ts` requires every figure a page
 * quotes to name the script that reproduces it, because a statistic you cannot
 * re-derive is a fabrication with a decimal point in it. Everything the maze
 * page says with a digit in it comes from here or from the game's own source.
 *
 * IT DRIVES THE SHIPPED REDUCER. `newMaze`, `tap`, `optimalRoute`, `distances`,
 * `openNeighbours` and `isSolved` are imported from `src/games/maze/logic.ts`
 * rather than re-written, so every deal below is a deal a child could actually
 * be handed - the same carve, the same braid, the same rule that a route picks
 * up every crumb it walks over. A re-implementation would measure my reading of
 * the code, agree with itself, and be confidently wrong about a game we do not
 * ship.
 *
 * Three questions, and the first is the one worth a page:
 *
 *   1. IS THE OBVIOUS ORDER THE RIGHT ONE? The header of `logic.ts` claims the
 *      skill here is choosing an ORDER rather than reacting. That is measurable:
 *      play each deal three ways - the brute-forced optimum, a bot that always
 *      walks to the nearest crumb, and a bot that takes them in reading order -
 *      and the gap between them IS the size of the skill, in steps.
 *
 *   2. HOW MUCH DOES THE ORDER MATTER AT ALL? Same deal, best order against
 *      worst order. If the spread is small the game has no puzzle in it; if it
 *      is large, "perfect" is a real thing to aim at.
 *
 *   3. IS EASY ACTUALLY A MAZE? `LEVELS.easy.braid` is 0.9, which opens nine in
 *      ten dead ends back up. So count the dead ends that survive, per level.
 *      This is the page's admission and it should be measured rather than
 *      asserted.
 *
 * Determinism: `mulberry32` from the game's own `@shared/rng`, seeded per deal,
 * so every row below replays exactly.
